Case: Anonymous phone call Don Jr is a regular user of cocaine. Should we publish?
  (from last class)

Argument for:
  - Sullivan case: Needs actual malice ("gross recklessness" or definitive knowledge
    that it's fake)
    - Doctrine: Statements against public officials that are proven false needs
      to reach a standard of actual malice

    - Case:
      - It was against a police commissioner -- not quite against a police officer
      - NYT runs an advertisement by Civil Rights group that tries to raise money
        in Alabama (height of the Civil Rights movement in America)
      - Falsehood: King was arrested fewer times than he was,
        "Dining hall was padlocked" which wasn't true,
        reason why students were expelled was also false
      - Civil case
        - Differences with criminal: Criminal has imprisonment; criminal cases
          brought by the state and has to be violating US code
          - Has to prosecute someone (prove something beyond reasonable doubt),
            while civil cases have a lower bar
          - Criminal has a jury trial
      - This is a civil case on tort (some person's personal rights have been violated
        by another person and you hold them liable for damages)
        - Someone, typically, acting negligently (below some standard of care) causes
          injury to another person, that person can sue for damages
        - Classic example: Someone drives a car negligently and hits another car,
          the other person can sue as a tort to recover damages for the car and personal injury
      - In this case, it is libel and defamation
        - If false statement of fact that is "of and concerning" an individual and it
          injures your reputation, then you may be able to recover damages.
        - Those damages could be psychological, or monetary (losing job)
      - Under Alabama tort law, Sullivan would have had to prove what libel is per se
        - "False statements" hence libel under Alabama, and the average person would
          read it and think less of Sullivan
        - When defendant does something and causes damages, I am able to recover it
          without having to show that the person doing it fell below some standard
          - Normal standard of behavior - the standard of care that reasonable people
            would have exhibited (otherwise known as negligence)
          - Alabama cares a lot about reputation, thus you don't need to show the
            defendant fell below a bar
      - Sullivan wins the Appeals case
      - NYT wins the Supreme Court case and say there's no damages, also set out new standard:
        - "Of and concerning" is not strong enough for libel cases
        - Needs to be proof of actual malice
        - When it comes to criticism or commentary about public officials, you cannot
          be held libel for damages or false statements of fact about that public official,
          unless if the official can show that you made that false statement of fact with
          actual malice, meaning not malice in the dictionary sense, but you know
          what you were saying was false, or you published it in reckless disregard
      - Holmes in Abrams v Sullivan: Sullivan emphasizes freedom of speech and press to
        democracy and self-governance, while Holmes talks about value of freedom of speech
        and press to the truth (broadly)
      - Rosen: Holmes set 1A on bad course by talking about search for truth,
        because 1A is really about the town hall and citizens are the ultimate sovereign
        - For thousands of years, people thought the power of the state rested in a king
          or queen (they were the sovereign), what American introduced was to take
          that sovereign power and put it in the hands of citizens
    - If you are the sovereign, you cannot have an agent for the citizens block speech
    - Central meaning of 1A - sovereignty lies in the public and in the citizens, and
      they deserve full protection to exercise their self-governing rights
    - Court feels is has to be judicious and reserved
      -
