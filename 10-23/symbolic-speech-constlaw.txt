Symbolic speech
  - Nonverbal conduct was a means of "symbolic" expression

US v O'Brien
  - Case: O'Brien burned their draft cards in public. O'Brien then told FBI agents
    that he burned his cards because of his beliefs, and knew that it violated
    federal law
    - Court of Appeals held the anti draft card burning amendment (1965 Amendment)
      as unconstitutional in abridging freedom of speech
  - Court: 1965 Amendment is "constitutional both as enacted & applied"
    - Does not abridge free speech on its face, as the actual burning of a draft card
      is not necessarily expressive
    - Conduct isn't always labeled speech "whenever the person engaging in the
      conduct intends thereby to express an idea"
    - When speech and non-speech elements are combined in the same course of conduct,
      a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the non-speech
      element can justify incidental limitations on 1A freedoms
      - Constitutional power of Congress to raise and support armies and to make
        all laws necessary and proper to that end is broad and sweeping
      - Protecting draft cards is a legitimate national interest
    - The 1965 Amendment is an "appropriately narrow means of protecting this
      interest and condemns only the independent non-communicative impact of conduct"
    - Court also cannot strike down a constitutional statute on the "basis of an
      alleged illicit legislative motive" (O'Brien argued that Congress passed
      this law in order to "suppress speech")
    - Lays out the incidental effect doctrine (see below)
    - Four part O'Brien test:
      (1) Regulation furthers a substantial government interest
      (2) Government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression
      (3) Restrictions imposed are no greater than necessary to further gov't interest
      (4) Government has the constitutional authority to enact the law

Tinker v Des Moines School District
  - Case: School officials suspected 3 students because they wore black armbands
    to protest the Vietnam war.
  - Court:
    - Invalidated the suspensions
    - "Wearing of an armband for the purpose of expressing certain views is the
      type of symbolic act that is within 1A"
    - School authorities did not prohibit wearing all symbols of political significance,
      but rather a particular symbol -- i.e viewpoint discrimination

Schacht v US
  - Case: Schacht demonstrated against Vietnam War, and was convicted for unauthorized
    wearing of an American military uniform
  - Court: Reversed the conviction
    - Cited O'Brien: The misused of American military uniform statute IS valid on its
      face
    - However, the Court also found that Schacht is wear the American military uniform
      for a theatrical production, which IS legally protected
    - With that statute out of the way, Court decided cannot send the dude to prison
      for protesting the Vietnam War, since it is a fundamental abridgement of 1A

NAACP v Alabama
  - Case: Alabama statute required all out-of-state corporations doing business in
    the state to disclose names and addresses of all Alabama members
  - Court: Statute was invalid as applied
    - Rare case of the Court striking down a statute because of the incidental
      restriction on expression
    - Court found that revealing identity of NAACP rank-and-file members would
      hurt the members quite significantly, thus the incidental restriction on
      expression would seriously hurt NAACP and its members to pursue their
      constitutional rights

Incidental effect doctrine
  - Incidental effect on 1A is justified when state is attempting to pursue
    legitimate interests
  - Requires two conditions:
    (1) Law is not directed at speech
    (2) It is not the expressive element of the act that causes the harm the
      state seeks to prevent
  - If harm is caused by the message, the incidental effect doctrine is inapplicable

Holder v Humanitarian Law Project
  - Case: Constitutionality of federal statute declaring it unlawful for anyone to
    provide "material support" to a foreign terrorist organization, where material
    support includes expert advice (such as for legal advice)
  - Government argued that the statute only had an incidental effect on speech,
    and that the O'Brien should govern
  - Court:
    - Rejected the government's argument
      - O'Brien does not give a standard for reviewing content-based regulation of speech
      - This material support statute is content based
      - Said Cohen v California is more applicable
    - But still upheld the statute on other grounds

Flag burning
  - Street v New York
    - Case: Street took a flag to a nearby street corner and burned it. Convicted of
      violating New York statute making it misdemeanor to mutilate ... or 'cast
      contempt upon either by words or acts' any flag of the US
    - Court: Overturned conviction
      - Held that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to the case because
        it permitted him to be punished merely for speaking defiant or contemptuous
        words about the American flag
      - However, it ducked whether or not burning the flag itself should be protected
  - Smith v Goguen
    - Case: Smith wore a small cloth replica of the US flag and was convicted for
      "publicly mutilate, trample upon, deface or treat contemptuously the flag
      of the US"
    - Court: Overturned the conviction
      - The statute was void for vagueness
      - Appellee was charged not with any act of physical desecration but with
        "publicly treating contemptuously the flag of the US". The Court noted
        that casual treatment of the flag in many context is widespread amongst youth
      - Thus the treating contemptuous clause is inherently vague
  - Spence v Washington
    - Case: Spence protested the Vietnam War and Kent State killings by displaying
      the US flag with a large peace symbol over it. Convicted under Washington's
      "flag misuse" statute, which prohibited superimposing anything on the flag
    - Court: Overturned conviction
      - Blocking "a pointed expression of anguish by appellant about the affairs of his
        government" is "impermissible infringement of free expression"
      - This was is unrelated to O'Brien because it is content related (rather
        than content neutral which O'Brien applies to)
    - Court makes an interesting declaration: All flag misuse statutes are
      "directly related to expression" and thus inapplicable to O'Brien
  - Texas v Johnson
    - Case: Johnson burned an American flag as a political demonstration in 1984
      Republican Convention. Was convicted of violating Texas flag desecration
      statute, which made it a crime for any person to "deface, damage or otherwise
      physically mistreat" the flag "in a way that the actor knows will seriously offend
      one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action"
    - Court: Overturned conviction
      - Flag burning has enough "elements of communication" to implicate the
        First Amendment
        - State may not prevent particular conduct because it has expressive elements
        - O'Brien only allowed incidental limitations on speech elements of conduct
          if the Government's interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression
        - The state here is aiming to squash the expressive element of flag burning
          (desecration of a symbol of the nation). The underlying bedrock of 1A is
          that "the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply
          because societry finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable"
      - State does NOT have a legitimate interest in using the statute to prevent
        breaches of peace
    - Dissent led by Justice Rehnquist
      - Citing Chaplinsky: Flag burning is no essential part of any expression of ideas
      - Johnsons' act could have been conveyed in a dozen different ways, thus
        the Texas statute is limited in scope
  - US v Eichman
    - Case: After Johnson case, Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act, making it
      a crime to "knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn, maintain on the
      floor or ground, or trample upon any flag of the United States"
    - Court: Invalidated this act
      - Even though the act explicitly stated that it was meant to "protect the physical
        integrity of the flag under all circumstances", it was clear that the
        government's asserted interest is related to the suppression of free expression.
      - Mere destruction of a physical manifestation of a symbol does not diminish
        the symbol itself in any way
      - Fundamental flaw of the act is that "it suppresses expression out of concern
        for its likely communicative impact". Since it is a content based restriction,
        it must undergo strict scrutiny. Since government's interests are not justified,
        the Act is unconstitutional

Barnes v Glen Theatre
  - Case: Two nude dancing establishments challenge Indiana's public indecency
    statute, which prohibits any person to appear in a state of nudity in any public place
  - Court: Declared the statute is fine under 1A
    - Nude dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within
      the outer perimeters of 1A
    - Applying the 4 part O'Brien test:
      - Preventing public indecency is a legitimate government interest, as the State
        has the power to uphold moral values
      - This government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression
      - The expressive element of the conduct (the nudity) that is causing harm
        to society. It is the public indecency that is the "evil the state seeks to
        prevent" -> gave an example about public nudity at beaches which is also
        banned but has no erotic expressive element
      - This statute is narrow in scope: Not trying to suppress the "erotic message"
        conveyed by the dancers -- dancers wearing G-strings would convey the same
        message but less graphically
  - Dissent:
    - These theaters have consenting adults who pay money to see these dances
    - The purpose of the statute is to protect people from the harmful message that
      nude dancing communicates -- but since it is seeking to protect people from
      the erotic message, thus it inhibits free expression

City of Eric v Pap's AM
  - Case: Eric enacted ordinance banning public nudity. The preamble stated that
    the purpose of the ordinance was to respond to recent increase in nude live
    entertainment within the city, which adversely effects the city. A nude dancing
    establishment sued.
  - Court: Upheld the ordinance
    - General ban on all nudity, whether or not it is expressive (thus content-neutral)
    - State also has a legitimate interest in "preventing harmful secondary effects
      not related to the suppression of expression", which includes crime
    - Expression also has meaningful alternatives: Performers are able to wear G-strings
      and pasties, thus it does not prevent the speaker from expressing their
      erotic content

NAACP v Claiborne Hardware (Political boycotts)
  - Court invalidated a civil judgment against the NAACP for instituting a boycott
    of white merchants designed to induce business and civic leaders to adopt a number
    of reforms
  - "The speech does not lose its protected character simply because it may coerce
    others into action"

Rumsfeld v FAIR
  - Case: Law school banned military employers who discriminated against gays and lesbians
  - Court:
    - Exclusion by law schools of military recruiters is not "inherently expressive,"
      because such conduct has meaning only if the law schools accompany their conduct
      with speech explaining it.
    - i.e when you see a military recruiter ushered away, you don't know for what reason
      that is happening (maybe all the meeting rooms are full?)
    - Thus, "explanatory speech is necessary"
    - Also held that the statute serves the government legitimate interest in
      facilitating military recruitment

Doe v Reed
  - Case: Washington state public records statute that authorizes public disclosure
    of the names of individuals who sign referendum petitions
  - Court concluded that petition signing remains expressive even when it has
    a legal effect on the electoral process

Nevada Communication on Ethics v Carrigan
  - Case: A state legislator committed an ethics violation by voting for a casino
    project that his campaign manager ran. However, he claimed that his vote is
    a right under the First Amendment
  - Court:
    - Legislator's votes are not protected speech: "The legislative power thus
      committed is not personal to the legislator but belongs to the people;
      the legislator has no personal right to it"
    - Votes by legislators are different from votes by citizens
    - Doe v Reed stated that an inherently expressive act remains so despite a government
      act. But in this situation, Carrigan is claiming that "a governmental act
      becomes expressive simply because the governmental actor wishes it to be so"
