10.23.19 - symbolic speech (1317-1339)
·        How do we determine if there is a cause for action of defamation
o   Determine if the person is a public figure or a public official
·        Would you rather have a Public Figure or a Public Official? – both achieve actual malice standard
o   Public official is more absolute – a couple stipulations
§  Some employees of the state aren’t public officials the requirements are those that
·        Have influence in power
·        Capacity to have his or her voice known to correct falsehoods
o   (Truth may never catch up to the lie)
o   (Dissuade people from entering public official)
o   Public figure
§  Someone who thrusts themselves into the public controversy with the purpose of effecting this resolution
·        All purpose public figure – Gulliani
·        limited purpose public figure
·
o   lines drawn about who can have actual malice – where are the boundaries
§  1. public official or public figure
§  2. what is public controversy?
·        Is gurtz and times about protecting a zone of speech about classic political controversy and excluding things that are not political public controversy’s (like firestone)
o   Maybe ppl care about divorce issues but they aren’t the kind of public issues we want to protect?
o   NYT v Sullivan important because it gave a particular theoretical grounding for the first amendment about democracy and self-government
§  Excluding entertainment & low culture might be too stringent
·        (ability of counter speech as established by brandenburg)
·        New Hypothetical
o   Man thinks that it is atrocious that Donald trump is being subjected to Impeachment. We decide that to make our statement we are going to build a huge bonfire in Central Park. People threw stones and they were carrying signs and it was fun. Got arrested! Going to be on nightly news! Unique message to express emotion
·        Public defender defending him
o   Apply O’Brien
·        Under the first amendment, we know that words are often protected (language). Does it protect other forms of communication
o   Yes the first amendment protects behavior that is communicative other than words
§  When people march, dress, etc all are communicative of something
o   How MUCH behavior or action is communicative?
§  Burning down a building still is communicative, how do we chose what behavior we can protect
§  Obrien gives us the answer!!
·        O’brien
o   When it involves only speech it is all under the First Amendment
o   When something includes speech+ the court is more deferential to a state
§  Balancing approach
o   Tom emerson
§  The court in trying to resolve this problem uses a rationale that doesn’t make sense. There is no distinction between speech and other forms, all behavior is expressive. What is the primary thing that is happening in the action? Is it that they are primarily communicating or primarily doing something else.
§  People said naw you are wrong there is no way to differentiate
o   THEN Obrien happened
§  Burnt his draft card on the steps of the supreme court in SC
§  This violated a statue that said someone can’t mutilate or destroy their draft card which is required to be carried with you at all times
·        The reason for this is that if the country needed you someone could approach you and take your draft card, must have it on your body so that we can mobilize an army / military. Was a crime to not have the draft card on him which happened when he burnt the draft card.
§  If the motive of the law is to reduce the communicative impact of the behavior then it is a “track 1 analysis” – cohen & brandenburg etc
§  If it is track two the court will balance the interest of the government and the individual freedom
·        Law of the hypothetical that gets
o   Anyone who burns a bonfire against impeachment will be prosecuted
§  This is the suppression of speech – track 1 analysis – cohen
§
·        How do we know what motives were?
o   In O’Brien – that was implicitly motivated by the desire to punish anti-war protests, YET the government said it was content neutral
§  Court says that it wont look behind the motive
o   Flag burning cases tho
§  Says that the intention is not just about a content neutral thing
·        Court looks behind content neutrality
