Public Forum
  - Private Property: Generally accepted that private property cannot be forced
    to yield First Amendment rights
  - Evolved along two lines: (1) streets and parks, (2) all other publicly own property

Streets and Parks
  - Massachusetts v Davis
    - Case: Davis, a preacher, was convicted under city ordinance that forbade
      "any public address" on any publicly owned property except in accordance
      with a permit from the mayor
      - Mass. Supreme Court: Upheld the conviction
      - Justice Holmes on the court stated that the legislature may choose to block
        public speaking on public property like "the owner of a private house to
        forbid it in his house"
        - Thus the gov't may "take the lesser step of limiting the public use to
          certain purposes"
    - Court: Also upheld the conviction
      - Embraced Justice Holmes' position
      - Constitution does not give a citizen the right to use public property
        "in defiance of the constitution and laws of the State"

  Hague v CIO
    - Case: Court considered the constitutionality of an ordinance forbidding all
      public meetings in the streets and other public places without a permit
    - Court: Rejected the statute's constitutionality
      - Streets and parks "have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the
        public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
        communicating thought between citizens, and discussing public questions"
      - Street and park regulation may be done "in consonance with peace and good
        order" and also "in the interest of all". But use for 1A purposes may
        not be abridged or denied
      - Initial creation of the public forum doctrine:
        - Applied the Holmes' common law property rights argument to the state & public trust
        - Creates two classes of public property: Those that satisfy time out of mind
          requirements (e.g streets and parks) and those that don't

  Schneider v State
    - Court held that a city's interest in keeping "the streets clean and of good
      appearance" was insufficient to prohibit distribution of leaflets on public property

  US v Grace
    - Case: Federal statute prohibiting any person to display any flag, banner, etc
      on the public sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court.
    - Court: Invalidated the statute
      - Public sidewalks are public forums, and thus the government's ability to
        restrict expression in such places "is very limited"
      - The government MAY enforce "reasonable time place, and manner restrictions"
        in public forums only if the restrictions are
        (1) content neutral
        (2) narrowly tailored
        (3) serve a significant government interest
        (4) leave open ample alternative channels of communication

  Grayned v Rockford
    - Case: Demonstrators marched on public sidewalk next to public high school to
      protest school's racial policies. Convicted of violating a Rockford ordinance
      prohibiting any "person on public or private grounds adjacent to an in session
      school to make noise or diversion which disturbs the peace of such school"
    - Court: Affirmed the conviction
      - Although public sidewalk cannot be declared off limits for expressive activity,
        (1) having an uninterrupted school session for learning is a compelling government
            interest (government interest)
        (2) Punished only conduct that disrupts normal school activities (ample
          alternative channels of communication)
        (3) Requires the decision to be made on an individualized basis
          (narrowly tailored)
        (4) Gives no license to punish anyone because of what he saying
          (content neutral)
      - Basically tackled the question of "whether the manner of expression is
        basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place
        at a particular time" (see Adderley v Florida)

  Frisby v Shultz
    - Case: People picketed on public sidewalk outside of an abortion doctor's home.
        City placed ordinance banning residential picketing that focuses on a
        particular residence.
    - Court: Upheld the ordinance
      - It "left open ample alternative channels of communication", as protestors
        are able to go door-to-door, leaflet, or picket in a way that wasn't
        exclusive to that residence
      - Compelling government interest, since the privacy of the home is "of the
        highest order in a free civilized society"
      - Narrowly tailored, as it only impacts picketers that intrude on a targeted
        resident in an offensive way -- doesn't impact dissemination of message
        to the general public

  Clark v Community for Creative Non-Violence
    - Case: National Park Service allowed CCNV to erect symbolic tent cities on the mall
      for demonstration of homeless issues, but prohibited people from actually living
      in those parks
    - Court: Upheld the no sleeping regulation as a "reasonable time, place and manner
      restriction"
      - Regulation is content neutral since it is not targeting the expression around
        the plight of the homeless
      - Narrowly focuses Government's substantial interest on maintaining the parks
        in an attractive and intact condition

  Ward v Rock
    - Court upheld NYC regulation requiring the use of city-provided sound systems
      and technicians for concerts in the Bandshell in Central Park
      - Justification for the regulation was the city's desire to control noise
        levels to avoid intruding into other areas of the park & residential areas
    - Court said NYC gov't has substantial interest in protecting its citizens
      from unwelcome noise
      - Regulation also leaves open ample alternative channels of communication

  Madsen v Women's Health Center
    - Case: Petitioners violated injunction prohibiting them from blocking access
      to an abortion clinic and from harassing the patients and doctors. The state
      court issued new injunction
        (1) prohibiting demonstrating within 36 feet of clinic
        (2) exhibiting images observable by patients within the clinic
        (3) prohibited approaching patients within 300 ft of clinic
    - Court:
      - Upheld the 36 foot buffer zone (protects access to the clinic)
      - Invalidated the restriction on exhibiting "images observable" to patients,
        since the clinic could just "pull its curtains" (similar to averting one's eyes)
      - Invalidated prohibiting protestors from approaching people within 300 ft of
        clinic
        - 300 ft is larger than the zone upheld in the Frisby case
        - A smaller zone would have been constitutional

  Schenck v Pro Choice Network of Western New York
    - Case: Abortion clinics subjected to series of large-scale blockades. Other groups
      of protestors yelled and spit at women entering the clinics. Police officers
      controlling the protests were also harassed by the protestors
      - Federal court issued injunction that
        (a) prohibited them from demonstrating within 50 feet of clinic doorways
        (b) Prohibited them from demonstrating within 15 feet of any person or vehicle
            accessing the clinic
    - Court: Upheld (a), invalidated (b)
      - For (a), protests prevents abortion clinics from being able to properly operate,
        thus it is okay
      - For (b), it prevents people from communicating a message from a normal
        conversational distance or handing leaflets to people, thus abridges free expression

  Hill v Colorado
    - Case: Colorado statute that makes it unlawful for anyone within 100 feet of
      healthcare facility to "knowingly approach" within 8 feet of another person to
      pass a leaflet, display a sign, or engage in oral protest
    - Court: Upheld the statute
      - Citing Frisby, stated that offensive messages cannot be protected if it
        is so intrusive that unwilling audience cannot avoid it
      - "No one has a right to press even good ideas on an unwilling recipient"
      - The statute is a "valid time, place, and manner regulation that serves
        the governmental interests that are significant and legitimate; also
        narrowly tailored to serve those interest and leaves open ample alternative
        channels for communication"

  McCullen v Coakley
    - Case: Massachusetts statute that prevented people from standing on a sidewalk
      within 35 feet of an entrance of a hospital where abortions are performed
    - Court: Invalidated the ordinance
      - Government ability to restrict speech on sidewalk is very limited
      - Buffer zones burden "substantially more speech than necessary to achieve
        Massachusetts' asserted interests"
        - Pointed to other laws that criminalized harassing people who enter the
          facility, or NYC law that prevented following another person within 15
          feet of an abortion facility

  Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v Pinette
    - Court suggested that "a ban on all unattended displays" in a public park
      might be constitutional

  Licensing
    Cox v New Hampshire
      - Case: Jehovah's Witnesses were convicted of violated statute prohibiting any
        parade or procession upon a public street without first obtaining a permit
      - Court: Affirmed the convictions
        - Regulation of the use of streets for parades is already accepted, the only
          question is if the regulation "unwarrantedly abridged the right of assembly"
        - The licensing authority could only take into considerations such as "time,
          place and manner" to conserve the public convenience. The authority also was
          NOT vested with arbitrary power, and could not deny based on the content
          - Thus this licensing authority was constitutional as it was limited and
            only allowed to license based on already accepted public forum doctrine

    Watchtower Bible & Tract Society v Village of Stratton
      - Case: "Time, place, and manner" licensing scheme for individuals who want
        to go door-to-door to speak with homeowners and distribute literature
      - Court: Invalid scheme
        - Places a burden on speakers who want to remain anonymous, and also limitations
          on "spontaneous" speech is an undue burden on 1A

    Murdock v Pennsylvania
      - Court ruled a State may not impose a flat license tax for assembly activities,
        as different circumstances will have different costs to the government
      - But governments may impose a nominal fee to cover things like security,
        clean up, etc

    Forsyth County v The Nationalist Movement
      - Court invalidated ordinance that authorized permit fees for parades, marches
        up to a maximum of $1000 based on anticipated expense to maintain public order
      - Invalid because the administrator may charge parades that they don't like more
      - Speeches cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can b punished or
        banned simply because it might offend a hostile mob

  Disclosure
    Talley v California
      - Case: Ordinance requiring the name and address of the person who printed,
        wrote and compiled on all leaflets distributed on the streets
      - Court: Held the ordinance invalid
        - Identification requirement would restrict freedom to distribution information,
          and thus freedom of expression
        - Anonymous pamphlets and leaflets have played an important role in protests

    McIntyre v Ohio Elections Commission
      - Court invalidated state statute prohibiting distribution of literature that
        does not have the name and address of the person issuing the literature
      - "Anonymity is an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent. Anonymity
        is a shield from the tyranny of the majority"

    Buckley v Valeo -> compelled disclosure of campaign contributions

    NAACP v Alabama -> requiring disclosure of members threaten their economic or
      employment standing

Other Public Property
  - Adderley v Florida
    - Case: Students marched to the county jail to protest the arrest of civil rights
      demonstrators. They blocked the entrance. The county sheriff ordered students
      to leave otherwise they would be arrested for trespassing. They didn't and were
      convicted of Florida statute for "trespass upon the property with a malicious
      and mischievous intent"
    - Court: Affirmed the convictions
      - Sheriff did not object to the content of the protest, only to their presence
        on jail grounds blocking jail uses
      - Jails are not "immemorially" used for expressive activities, thus the State
        has private property rights to control its use for which it is lawfully dedicated
        - No constitutional right for petitioners to stay on the property
    - Dissent:
      - Jailhouses hold political prisoners, and people have the right to petition
        for the redress of grievances
      - "Methods should not be condemned as tactics of obstruction and harassment
        as long as the assembly and petition are peaceable, as these were"
      - Can't banish all non street and park property from protests
  - Greer v Spock
    - Case: A candidate for president (Spock) wanted to hold a political meeting with
      military personnel at a military base. This base has unrestricted parts
      and roads that are open to civilians. However, base had regulation banning
      political speeches and activities on the base. Is this regulation constitutional?
    - Court: Affirmed the regulation
      - Quoting Adderley: "The State, no less than a private owner of property, has
        power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is
        lawfully dedicated"
      - Military base is meant to "train soldiers, not to provide a public forum"
  - Heffron v Int'l Society for Krishna Consciousness
    - Case: Minnesota State Fair has a rule that prohibited sale or distribution of
      materials without a booth rented from the state. The booths are rented in a
      nondiscriminatory manner on a first come first served basis. The rental charge
      is dependent on the size and location of the booth. This rule was challenged
      for hurting ISKCON's ability to distribute its literature
    - Court: Upheld the State Fair's rules
      - State has a more legitimate interest in crowd control in a state fair
        because of how compact it is and the number of visitors at any given moment
      - This is also only a place or manner restriction as well, not a content one
  - US Postal Service v Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations
    - Case: Federal statute prohibiting the deposit of unstamped "mailable matter"
      in a letter box approved by the USPS
    - Court: Affirmed the statute
      - Letter box is not a constitutional forum, neither historically (strict regulation
        by Congress and USPS) nor constitutionally
      - Letter box is similar to military base (Greer) or a jail (Adderley), as it
        is government property that is NOT a public forum
        - Even so, government regulation MUST be content neutral, which it is in this case
  - Los Angeles v Taxpayers for Vincent
    - Court upheld LA ordinance prohibiting posting signs on public utility poles
    - This is a content neutral restriction
    - Legitimate government interest in preventing "the visual assault on citizens
      by accumulation of signs posted on public property"
    - This limit is no broader than necessary to protect the City's interest
    - "The mere fact that gov't property can be used as a vehicle for communication
      does not mean that the Constitution requires such use to be permitted"
  - US v Kokinda
    - Case: A political advocacy group set up table on a sidewalk near an entrance
      to a US Postal Office to distribute literature. The sidewalk is on the Postal
      Service property. They were convicted of regulation prohibiting people from
      soliciting contributions on postal premises
    - Court: Upheld the regulation as applied
      - "Postal sidewalk does not have characteristics of public sidewalks traditionally
        open to expressive activity" -> purely means for "passage of individuals
        engaged in postal business"
      - Postal property is not a public forum, thus regulation must
        (1) be reasonable
        (2) not be an effort to suppress expression merely because officials opposed
            the content
      - The sidewalk also isn't a "limited-purpose" public forum even though individuals
        are allowed to leafletting or picketing on postal premises
        - Government does not create a public forum by permitting limited discourse
        - It can only do so by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse
        - Otherwise it would dis-incentivize the government from dedicating its property
          to any speech activities at all
  - Int'l Society for Krishna Consciousness v Lee
    - Case: Port Authority of NY and NJ owns the NYC airports and forbids within
      airport terminals the repetitive solicitation of money & sale and distribution of any
      merchandise, which includes brochures, pamphlets, books or any other material.
      This only applies terminal buildings and not the sidewalks outside of buildings
    - Court: Upheld the ban on solicitation but invalidated the ban on sale or
      distribution of literature
      - Solicitation: Airport terminals are not public forum because "given the lateness
        with which the modern air terminal has made its appearance, it hardly qualified
        for the immemorially time out of mind" qualification for purposes of expressive
        activity.
        - Because the airport terminal does not have a principal purpose "promoting
          the free exchange of ideas," it is not a public forum
        - Thus prohibition on solicitations only need to satisfy a requirement of
          reasonableness, which is satisfied because of the disruptive effect that
          solicitation may have on business -- impeding the flow of traffic where a delay
          could mean a missed flight. Also reasonable because solicitation is allowed
          on the sidewalks outside of the terminals, where an "overwhelming" amount
          of airport users can be reached
      - Sale or distribution of literature:
        - This ban violated 1A, because "the right to distribute flyers and literature
          lies at the heart of the liberties guaranteed"
          - Regulation not drawn narrowly and does not leave open ample alternatives
        - Port Authority's concerns with congestion can be addressed through narrow
          restrictions on the time and place of expressive activity
    - Solicitation dissent by Justice Kennedy:
      - Airports ARE public forums -- cannot just rely on historical use cases
        - Airports are one of the few public spaces where people have extended contact
          with other members of the public; bears important physical similarities
          to a street
      - But, found that the solicitation regulation is okay because it is a reasonable
        "time, place, and manner restriction"

When does a public forum occur on private property?
  - Marsh v Alabama (company town)
    - Case: Should state impose criminal punishment on person who distributes literature
      on premised of a company town against the wishes of the town's management.
      The person was convicted for prohibiting a person to enter premises of another
      after having been warned not to do so
    - Court: Overturned the conviction
      - Ownership "does not always mean absolute dominion"
      - The owner opened his property for use by the public in general, and thus
        public users gain constitutional rights
      - State cannot permit a corporation to govern a community of citizens so as
        to restrict their fundamental liberties and the enforcement of such restraint
        by application of a state statute
  - Shopping malls
    - Food Employees Local v Logan Valley Plaza
      - Court held that peaceful picketing of a business enterprise cannot constitutionally
        be prohibited by the owner of the shopping center
    - Hudgens v NLRB
      - Logan Valley was overruled, and the property rights of the owner of the
        shopping center prevailed
  - Appropriation of private property for speech purposes
    - PruneYard Shopping Center v Robins
      - Court upheld part of California Constitution that allowed for speech and
        petitioning, reasonably exercised, in shopping center even when the centers
        are privately owned
      - Rejected PruneYard's 5th Amendment argument that it constitutes "destruction
        or injury to property by government action" -> allowing free expression does not
        impair the value or use of the property as a shopping center
      - The shopping center is open to the public, unlike someone's private home
      - There is also ample room for PruneYard to indicate disapproval of messaging
        (e.g by putting up signs where the protestors are)

Public Forum Underinclusion
  - Regulation that restricts less speech than a broader constitutional content-neutral
    restriction (e.g treats content differently)
    - Not a question of if the government may restrict the other speech -- it is
      already accepted to be allowed to be restricted; it is if it can ALLOW additional
      speech that was allowed to be restricted

  - Police Department of Chicago v Mosley
    - Case: Chicago ordinance banning picketing or demonstrating within 150 ft of
      any school building while the school is in session, with the exception that
      picketing about labor disputes are allowed
      - A guy, Mosley, picketed about racial discrimination, and sued saying the
        ordinance distinguished between labor picketing and other peaceful picketing
    - Court: Ordinance is unconstitutional bc it makes content distinction for picketing
      - Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment is relevant for treating
        picketing differently
      - The government may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it
        finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less favored
        or more controversial views; and may not select which issues are worth discussing
      - Exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone
      - This regulation is NOT a time, place, or manner regulation but of subject matter
      - Subject matter regulation MUST be subject to strict scrutiny, and in this case
        there is no compelling government interest to allow labor picketing specifically
  - Cary v Brown
    - Case: Peaceful demonstration in front of the home of the Chicago mayor, protesting
      his failure to achieve racial integration. Demonstrators were convicted of violating
      Illinois statute declaring it "unlawful to picket before or about the residence
      of any person, except when the residence is a place of employment involved
      in a labor dispute"
    - Court: Held that this statute was indistinguishable from the one invalidated in Mosley
      - Accords preferential treatment to the expression of views on one particular subject
      - Equal Protection Clause mandates legislation be finely tailored to serve
        substantial state interests
  - Widmar v Vincent
    - Case: University of Missouri allowed student groups to meet in university facilities,
      but adopted a regulation prohibiting the use of university buildings for
      religious worship or religious teaching
    - Court: Invalidated the regulation
      - Campus of a public university is essentially a public forum for its students
        - The main difference is that a university has a mission for education and
          can impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the
          use of its campus and facilities
      - Referenced Cary v Brown as it must serve a compelling state interest and is narrow
        drawn.
      - Allowing a religious organization from enjoying merely "incidental" benefits
        of the university facilities does not violate the prohibition on the State
        advancing religion (separation of Church and State)
        - Thus the state interest is compelling, but not narrowly drawn
  - Case where Mosley careful scrutiny IS satisfied:
    - Burson v Freeman: Court upheld law prohibiting the solicitation of votes and
      display of campaign materials within 100 feet of a polling place
  - Lehman v City of Shaker Heights
    - Case: Rapid transit system sells advertising space. Is it required (by 1st & 14th
      Amendments) to accept paid political advertising on behalf of a candidate for
      public office?
      - The city accepted ads from cigarette companies, banks, liquor companies,
        churches and other controversial industries
    - Court: The transit car is not a public forum
      - Transit cars is purely for a city's commercial purposes (providing transit),
        thus the car advertising space is part of the commercial venture
        (not a public forum)
      - Thus, city transit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable choices
        concerning the type of advertising displayed in its vehicles
      - This regulation in particular is not "arbitrary, capricious, or invidious"
      - Allowing political advertisements on a car may jeopardize the transit system's
        long term revenue stream (by pissing off transit users) -> also the city
        is attempting to prevent showing favoritism politically, thus the
        State interests are compelling and legitimate
        - No 1A infringement as long as city limits advertising to "innocuous
          and less controversial commercial and service oriented advertising"
      - Transit car advertising is an example of "captive audience" -> where the
        audience cannot avoid the expression, thus legitimate interest in preventing it
    - Justice Douglas concurrence:
      - Petitioner has no right to force his message upon an audience incapable
        of declining to receive it
    - Dissent:
      - Public service advertisements convey messages of public concern and are
        protected by 1A -> the fact that the transit agency took these advertisements
        meant they were creating a space of public forum
      - Preventing political discussions but allowing public service announcements
        is antithetical to 1A
      - Subject matter censorship is forbidden -- commercial and public service
        announcements concern public matters
      - Passengers could also just "avert their eyes" (Cohen v California)
  - Perry Educator's Association v Perry Local Educators' Association
    - Case: School district operates inter-school mail system to transmit messages
      between teachers and school administration. Some private organizations also
      have access to the system.
      - Perry Educator's Association (PEA) was certified as the exclusive bargaining
        representative of the district's teachers, thus PEA was the only union
        with access to the mail system
      - PLEA is a rival union and claimed the district access policy violated the
        Constitution
    - Court: Upheld the district policy
      - Three types of government property
        (1) Street and parks, the quintessential public forums
        (2) Public property which the state has voluntarily (& temporarily) opened
            for use as a public forum
        (3) Public property not by tradition or designation a public forum
      - (1) and (2) will require strict scrutiny, but (3) only requires 'reasonable'
        regulation that is 'content neutral'
      - School mail falls under (3), since the school mail system was selectively
        opened to other organizations and not open to the general public
        - This selective access does not transform it into a public forum
      - Also not viewpoint discrimination, since it only allowed organizations based
        on status (as a union) and not their views
        - Speaker identity distinguishment is okay
      - State has a legitimate interest in preserving the property for use that it
        was lawfully dedicated

Quintessential, Designated, and Nonpublic Forums
  - Cornelius v NAACP (Distinction among charities)
    - Case: CFC is a charitable fundraising drive conducted in federal workplace
      during working hours
    - Court upheld Executive Order limiting the participation in the CFC to voluntary
      tax-exempt nonprofit charitable agencies, EXCLUDING legal defense and political
      advocacy organizations
      - CFC is a nonpublic forum because charities have selective access to it (Perry)
      - Control over access to a nonpublic forum can be content and identity based,
        as long as the distinctions are "reasonable in light of the purpose" and
        "viewpoint neutral"
      - This regulation was reasonable because
        (1) President wanted to prioritize food and shelter aid over litigation
        (2) Legal defense and political advocacy groups would generate controversy,
            and disrupt the federal workplace
        (3) Also avoids the appearance of government favoritism over certain viewpoints
  - Ysursa v Pocatello Education Association (union political activities)
    - Case: Idaho law that prevents payroll deductions for union political purposes.
            Challenged on infringing on 1A
    - Court: Upheld the Idaho law
      - NOT subsidizing the exercise of a fundamental right is not an infringement on it
        - State is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll deductions at all
      - Thus the state only needs to demonstrate that the regulation is "reasonable"
        - State wants to avoid the appearance of government favoritism in partisan
          politics, which is a reasonable justification
  - Arkansas Educational TV Commission v Forbes
    - Case: AETC decided to limit 1992 debates to major party candidates "or
      other candidates who had strong popular support". Forbes is an independent
      candidate, and satisfy ballot qualifications, but was refused to be included
      in the debates. Claims his exclusion violated 1A
    - Court: Upheld AETC's right to exclude
      - "A designated public forum is not created when the government allowed selective
        access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers"
      - Thus, AETC debates are not a designated public forum
      - Excluding people for not having popular support is NOT based viewpoint discrimination,
        and was "reasonable in light of the purpose of the property"
  - Walker v Texas Division Sons of Confederate Veterans (license plates)
    - Court held Texas did NOT create a limited public forum when it permitted
      private groups to submit proposals for specialty license plates
    - Upheld refusal of Texas DMV to approve license plate featuring the Confederate
      battle flag on the ground that the plate is government, not private, speech
    - License plates are a nonpublic forum because the state is engaging in expressive
      conduct

Limited public forums - Lehman, Greer, Cornelius and Perry cases

Viewpoint Neutrality in face of religious expression
  - Lamb's Chapel v Moriches Union Free School District
    - Case: School district rule permitted after-school social, civic, and recreational
      uses of school property, but prohibited religious purposes
      - School rejected Lamb's Chapel's request to show religious-oriented films
        concerning family values and childrearing
    - Court: Invalidated the school rule because it was not viewpoint neutral
      - Rejected the notion that it was subject matter rather than viewpoint
        - The actual premise of the film (family values) was okay, but it was not okay
          for being shown from a religious perspective -> hence viewpoint discrimination
  - Rosenberger v Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia
    - Court invalidated UVA policy authorizing payment from Student Activities Fund
      for printing costs of a variety of student publications, but prohibited
      payment for publications that promote a particular belief about a deity or
      ultimate reality
      - Suit brought by student org that offers Christian perspective and were denied
        printing funding
    - Court: Invalidated the school policy
      - Limited public forums can be reserved for certain groups or certain topics
      - But, this is seen as viewpoint discrimination and thus not okay, citing Lamb's Chapel
        - Religious perspective is denied rather than the subjects discussed
    - Dissent:
      - Cited Lehman and stated that banning religious orgs is NOT viewpoint discrimination
      - The policy explicitly bans SUBJECT MATTER discussion on a deity or ultimate reality,
        thus this case is different from Lamb's Chapel
    - Recall the debate over cross burning in RAV
  - Good News Club v Milford Central School
    - Case: School district authorized residents to use school buildings after hours
      for education or social, civic, recreational, etc uses but NOT religious purposes
      - Denied a request by Good News Club, a Christian organization
    - Court: Unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in limited public forum
      - Club seeks to address a subject otherwise permitted in the rule: the
        teachings or morals and character, but was denied because of their
        religious perspective on this subject
      - Thus this case is indistinguishable from Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger
    - Dissent:
      - Good News Club is more than religious perspective but wanted kids to
        worship as well as convert kids to Christianity, which NOT viewpoint discrimination
  - Christian Legal Society Chapter v Martinez
    - Case: Hastings College of Law, a public law school, extends recognition to
      student groups, which gives groups access to school funds, facilities, and other
      privileges. However, in exchange the student groups must abide by certain conditions,
      which includes a nondiscrimination policy. Hastings interprets this policy
      to mandate acceptances of ALL students to the student group.
      - Christian Legal Society requires members to sign a Statement of Faith,
        and excludes homosexuals or non-Christians from the group
      - Hastings rejected CLS's application on the grounds of discrimination for
        sexual orientation and religion
      - CLS claims this violates its 1A rights of expression and association
    - Court: Upheld the Hastings policy, rejecting CLS' claim
      - Hastings RSO program established a "limited public forum", and the Court
        permits restrictions within the limited public forum if they are reasonable
        and viewpoint neutral
      - The policy is reasonable because Hastings has an interest in affording
        all leadership and education and social opportunities to all students,
        and in avoiding using public money to subsidize discriminatory conduct
      - There are substantial alternative channels for CLS communication to take place
      - The policy is also viewpoint neutral as it requires all student groups to
        accept all comers, and has nothing in regards to the content of the group.
        CLS' conduct in rejecting such students not their perspective is what caused
        them to be denied.
      - Hastings isn't prohibiting CLS' expressive activity, but CLS has no constitutional
        right for state subsidy of its selectivity (Ysursa case)
    - Dissent:
      - Constitutionality of the nondiscrimination policy is viewpoint discriminatory
        - It allows environmentalist groups to reject students who don't believe in
          global warming, but forces religious groups to accept students that are
          not of the faith
      - The majority said the nondiscriminatory policy is okay because it is conduct
        based. But in this case the conduct is expressive.
  - Reed v Town of Gilbert
    - Court made clear that a less demanding standard of review is necessary for
      subject matter restrictions on nonpublic forums
    - How about subject matter restrictions that regulate speech on private property?
    - Case: Gilbert regulated signs displayed on private property that made distinctions
      on the signs based on its subject.
      - Good News Community Church was cited for exceeding the time limit for a
        sign displaying the time and location of upcoming service
    - Court: The ordinance is unconstitutional
      - The Town's code was content based on its face, and thus subject to strict
        scrutiny
        - Ordinance singles out a specific subject matter for differential treatment.
          Even though it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter,
          strict scrutiny still applies.
        - This is because 1A hostility to content-based regulations extends to
          prohibitions of public discussion of an entire topic
    - Dissent:
      - All sign ordinances are now subject to strict scrutiny
      - Helpful signs on streets and sidewalks (like hidden driveway signs)
        must be treated the same as any other sign
