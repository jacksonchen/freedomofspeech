=== Review ===

Hypothetical: Superintendent of the school. Publication that the superintendent
  is addicted to opioids. Assume that statement is also true.
  - This isn't defamation or libel because it is true
  - Cause of action that superintendent may have under these circumstances
    - Invasion of privacy (tort)
      - Must show
          (1) it is something not of value or of public interest
          (2) highly offensive/embarrassing to the reasonable person
          (3) must be a private fact (something that isn't already known in public)
        in order to recover damages
    - In some states that create cause of action for invasion of privacy

History on Right to Privacy
  - Sullivan and Girth set up cases around false statements of facts
  - These concept around damage from true statements of facts come from Hustler v Falwell
    (tort for intentional infliction of emotional distress)
    - That case states that statements that are not false that are also mocking
      and highly embarrassing may cause emotional distress and can be sued for damages
    - Supreme Court said they could not allow people to sue for emotional damages
      because of 1A doctrine
  - The tort (right to sue for damages) originates from 1890 Warren Brandeis published
    article saying the media has been too fascinated by people's private lives,
    they are publishing gossip and facts about people that even though are true
    are highly hurtful to those individuals. They claim this is bad for democracy
    and for society
  - There aren't that many right to privacy cases compared to defamation and libel cases
    - People who sue for privacy reasons make that fact more widely known
  - Has the Court held that the right to privacy is constitutional?
    - Court hasn't affirmed it, as the cases have been very narrowly decided
      (the cases Court has found saw facts are already of public record, and
      banned the State from prohibiting that speech)
    - Court hasn't decided on if the facts have been private
  - Social media and the Internet
    - Europe v US:
      - Europe has developed the "right to be forgotten", based on the notion that
        there should be private facts that should be able to be protected
      - There is no global court on this, right to be forgotten extending globally
        is dangerous for other countries who want to take down content for more
        nefarious reasons

IMPORTANT CASE: Hague v CIO (public forum doctrine)

New hypothetical: March in NYC for impeachment (in public) that brings about clashes. NY
  city gov't says it's too dangerous and we will not allow any more demonstrations
  in the city on the issue of impeachment. This society is experiencing a huge amount
  of stress and division.

  First Amendment issues
    - Hague v CIO case: The concept of a public forum (public forum doctrine of 1A) states
      that there are certain public property (in particular streets and parks) that
      MUST be open to expressive (i.e speech) activities
      - 1A protects actions as well, including marches and demonstrations
      - Unlike Commonwealth v Davis, the government cannot decide whether or not to
        keep streets open
    - Issue is that this is a ban on a topic that makes it unconstitutional
      (Mosley case)
    - Argument that this ban is content neutral because it bans all sides of impeachment
    - RAV: This ban is not content neutral

  Court said if you are content neutral, we will not expand Hague v CIO to other areas,
    as it would open a can of worms for what other parts of public property will be subject to it
    - Time place and manner isn't what actually determines constitutionally, it is
      content neutrality that determines constitutionality (e.g no impeachment
      rallies between 3 and 5)
    - Do the protections on speech increase the more the subject is a public official
      or do they lessen because the power is greater?

Private property and 1A
  - Can Bollinger stop any demonstrations from College Walk?
    - Yes because Columbia is a private university
  - Commonwealth v Davis: Private property owner, among the rights you have, can
    decide if people have the ability to come on your property and speak

  - When should, if ever, private property owners be required to make space
    available for speech?
    - Company town (company runs the city): Is that business a government
      for the purposes of 1A? Supreme Court said yes
    - During suburban transformation of America, should malls be treated like
      a public square even though malls are privately owned? Court initially said
      yes but then overturned it later
