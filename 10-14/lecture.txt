Exam logistics
  - Multiple choice ONLY on final
  - Only one hypothetical scenario is on this exam
    - With a couple questions relating to this hypothetical
  - Cover everything except libel, only goes up to hate speech
  - Start at 4:10 Wed sharp and end at 5:25 sharp
  - Open book, bring in personal notes (typed up notes are ok) and textbook
    - Laptops are allowed, but he would recommend printing
    - No Internet connection
  - Possible to have multiple issues in the same sentence
  - Sample question: Analyze the different claims
    - Prompt will not go line by line and ask what x means
  - When citing cases, make sure it's clear what the case is, don't necessary need
    to write the entire name out

Things to expect on the exam
  - How to write exam answers: IRAC (Issue Rule Application Conclusion)
    - Spotting the issue in scenario
    - What is the rule of law and what case does it come from?
      What is the standard we are following
    - Rules are unambiguous, but the application is ambiguous
  - Example: Going up to Trump and calling all Republicans dickheads
    - Issue: Is calling dickheads fighting words, and is it protected?
    - Rule: Fighting words standard
      - Directed at person (Cohen)
      - Lead to violence (Chaplinsky)
    - Application
      - Weigh whether or not rule applies and why
      - Make sure to reference cases since Chaplinsky, since the bar has been raised
        through several more recent cases
      - Could say that "Republicans" is more narrow than Cohen, and thus could
        apply as being directed
    - Conclusion
      - Which side does this fall under? Is this protected speech? Is statute constitutional?
      - Do not want wishy washy answer: Court or outcome will lean this way
      - It is fine to talk about ambiguity (that is important) but make sure to say what the position is
  - Writing style (not like a history paper)
    - Be as methodical and efficient at possible
    - Be brutally efficient at answering as many issues as possible, this is because
      the hypothetical will have a TON of issues, and you will not have time to write
      all of them
    - Once issue is done, go on to the next one, don't mull and continue to add
      elaboration, etc
  - If there is a question dealing with Columbia, it will be made clear if Columbia
    or the private institution has a policy waiving its ambiguity around the 1A compliance
  - Pay special attention to federal v state distinctions (what is operating at
    federal vs at state level)
    - 14th amendment applies 1st to state level, but don't need to know about
      incorporation for exam
  - How much description should go towards the issue & rule?
    - If it's straightforward, then keep it short
    - If complex then elaborate
  - Don't focus on dissents when talking about cases
  - If running low on time, make sure to hit as many points as possible, but
    there are style points
    - Won't lose points on irrelevant cases, but you're wasting time
  - Don't cite laws that have been overruled (like clear and present danger test)
    - Like don't waste time talking about Holmes and dissent, and talk about Brandenberg
      since that is the modern day test
  - FSC has interesting angles and insights that could be useful in offering alternative
    angles, but not necessary
    - Don't spend too much extra time revising FSC essays
    - Black letter law is in the textbook, FSC will be relevant in the final but
      not useful for black letter law
  - Scenarios will all be on current understandings, not on knowing laws in say 1950
  - When making citation, make sure it's relevant to that case

Substantive Questions
  - What does imminent mean? -> Can either use pure logic based on facts
    or relating it to a case
    - e.g Brandenberg is meant to be super protective, and Brandeis idea that there
      is opportunity for counterspeech to come into play
  - Lewd Speech (vs Indecent Speech)
    - Lewd and indecent doesn't really have a significant difference
    - Lewd vs obscenity
      - Lewd speech is offensive to "reasonable" people: "should really just
        calm the fuck down and make me a sandwich".
      - Doesn't comply with reasonable community norms
      - Obscenity deals with specifically sexual content
    - Fighting words v Lewd
      - Fighting words is meant to provoke someone into hostile response
      - Lewd speech does not necessary have a provocation quality; it may or may
        not be low value speech
        - Grotesquely offensive speech
  - Does low value means unprotected speech
    - No categorical definition or rule for low value speech
  - Strict scrutiny
    - When dealing with protected constitutional right (protected speech),
      if it does not fall under 1A exception, a law can still be good if it passes
      strict scrutiny (does States justification for the law compelling),
      does is means that the law uses the narrowest possible means
    - e.g shutting hate speech is compelling in St Paul, but there is something
      narrower that would work
    - Almost unheard of for law to pass strict scrutiny
    - Where to cite is: RAV v St Paul
    - Issue spotter will unlikely be applying strict scrutiny, since it is almost
      always comes out to be that the speech is protected
  - Chaplinsky is still good law, but its threshold is significantly higher now
    than it was in that case
    - Whitney is only case we've seen that's been explicitly overruled
    - Be careful about using Dennis, since it's almost entirely been supplanted by
      Brandenberg, so don't cite it
    - NYT and Hustler, group libel theory does not exist
  - Current law for fighting words is still Chaplinsky
    - But must note the more recent cases in that line that indicate threshold is higher
  - Pacifica: For broadcast channels
    - Social contract in terms of any broadcast that uses spectrum
    - However, if you are newspaper, there aren't a huge amount of limitations of what you
      can put out in reason
    - Broadcasters use government borrowed spectrum, and have stricter limitations
      on speech
    - This is one of those cases that's now narrower compared to when it was decided
      because of cases since then
  - Finer
    - This case hasn't been explicitly overruled yet
    - Eventual hostile audience doctrine, the judges talk about how there was much
      more differences from Finer
    - Finer is still good law
  - The cases Bollinger spent the most time on are the ones you should care about
    the most

Hypothetical on website
  - Issue: Advocacy of illegal conduct
    - "Oh and if anyone feels like vandalizing
      Bollinger's house, none of us are going to stop you either"
    - Brandenberg test
  - Issue: Obscenity with the genitalia on Bollinger's head
  - Issue: Fighting words with "bring this dickhead down", etc
    - Could also be lewd speech
