Case: We are reporting at Spec. Massive cheating scandal at Columbia with ringleaders,
  our source is there and we assure that we will protect them. After a bit, national
  media picks this up and is "yet another example of how corrupt our university system is".
  Bollinger is called by the State Attorney who is looking into this as a legal matter,
  and is required to testify. We now represent the Spec Reporter and Bollinger.
  Reporter promised to protect source by "never revealing her name to anybody"

How does Spec argue against revealing the identity of the whistleblower?
  - Assume no subpoena has been issued
  - Undermines the credibility of the newspaper as no one will want to reveal more
    information to them, also undermines the media's ability to function
  - Cohen v Cowles

  - What is subpoena has been issued? How to continue to argue against
    - 1A includes the right not to speak -- in this case Spec does not
      want to reveal identity of the source
      - Branzburg v Hayes invalidates this 1A right to not speak
    - Not really much the press can do in that situation

Principles of Press Privilege:
  - No legislation for reporters to claim privilege differently from ordinary citizens
  - Justice Powell's opinion in Branzburg:
    - It must be a criminal case for reporter to lose privilege
    - Motive of the prosecutor must be shown to abuse the power of prosecution
      for a vindictive motive, then the press is protected
  - Powell's opinion is generally accepted as the standard today
  - Legislation
    - There exists statutes in states that give reporters protection under certain
      conditions when facing state prosecution
    - Federal Shield law -> legislative rights for reporters; never passed

    Grand Jury proceeding
      - Secretive proceeding meant for criminal proceedings under the public record
        where officials must seek jury approval before going forward with criminal prosecution
      - In theory, means of protecting ordinary Americans from being charged with
        crimes by out of control prosecutors

    1960 - 1975 lots of 1A activity
      - 1972 Branzburg v Hayes
      - Brandenberg
      - Sullivan
      - Pentagon Papers

    Cohen v Cowles
      - State law against breach of contract
      - Source revealed something on the promise of confidentiality. The Court
        ruled that this constituted a contract.
      - Court rules 1A does not bar a suit against a reporter for disclosing information
        that the reporter promised not to disclose.

Case: Forcing the White House to turn over transcripts
  - Case for: Richmond Newspapers Case
    - Court held that the government cannot close off the court to the public
      and the press who want to attend
    - There is a 1A right to be there and attend
  - Case against:
