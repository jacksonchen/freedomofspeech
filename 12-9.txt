In libel action, public official bringing a claim must show "actual malic",
  which requires they show the defendant knew or acted with negligent disregard
  about the falsity of the statement

  False = "negligent disregard" is wrong, it should be reckless disregard

If a reporter gains access to confidential gov't info through unlawful means,
  the newspaper cannot be punished for publishing this information

  True:
    - Bartnicki v Vopper (newspaper got illegal recording of union official.
      Court ruled that even though info was illegally obtained, the newspaper wasn't
      the one doing the illegal obtaining)
    - Could also cite NYT v US (Justice Black's test)
    - Press has the right to publish any info it receives, even if it received it
      through unlawful means
      - The gov't can only go after those directly involved in the unlawful conduct

The first major Supreme Court decision that served to create the "clear and present"
  dangers' rule was:

  Frohwerk v US
  -> Schenck v US
  RAV v City of St Paul
  Dennis v US

Which of the following is most clearly NOT required for symbolic speech to be restricted?

  Must be content-neutral
  -> Must be passed by popular vote
  Must further a substantial gov't interest
  Must be incidental and no greater than is essential to the protection of that interest

------------------------
BASICS OF EACH DOCTRINE

12 doctrines:
  - Advocacy of Illegal Conduct
    - Speech and expression likely to incite imminent and illegal conduct will not be protected (Brandenburg)
  - Fighting words: Words likely to incite avg person to violence is not protected (Chaplinsky)
    - Has been narrowed down over time (Texas v Johnson, Street v NYC)
    - Must be directed at someone (Cohen v California)
    - Hostile audience
      - Feiner
      - Edwards v South Carolina
  - Obscenity: (Miller case) If average person finds
    (1) prurient interest [exclusively sexual]
    (2) speech or word depicts in a patently offensive way
    (3) lacks serious political, scientific, artistic value

    Way to find if its patently offensive
      - (a) describes normal sexual acts
      - (b) masturbation, excirtory functions, or "lewd exhibition of the genitals"
  - Lewd and profane/indecent speech
    - Similar to obscenity but not the same doctrine
    - Speech will generally not be constitutionally prohibited, as the listener just has
      to avert their eyes (Cohen v Cali)
    - Exception to this rule:
      - Speech over broadcast medium (Pacifica case)
        - Even a warning at the start of the broadcast will not be enough, people tune in at different times
          and they will be *surprised*
      - Zoning ordinances may prohibit indecent exhibitions (e.g strip clubs) -> justifiable
        in gov't interests in reducing crime and increasing quality of life (Young v American ...)
  - Hate speech
    - Protected under 1A
    - Any regulation that specifically targets speech because of its hateful viewpoint
      constitutes viewpoint discrimination, and thus unconstitutional. Even if that
      speech falls under a different unprotected category (RAV v St Paul)
      - Targeting cross burning as a form of fighting words, you can't ban that (viewpoint discrimination)
    - Hateful conduct motivated by hateful intentions (assault based on discriminatory intentions) MAY be
      punished more
      - Wisconsin v Mitchell
  - Libel
    - Public official or figure may only recover damages for a defamatory falsehood if they
      can show "actual malice". Satisfied in one of two ways
      (1) Knowledge that the statement is false
      (2) Reckless disregard for the fact that it is false
    - NYT v Sullivan
    - Who is public figure?
      - "All purpose": ppl who have achieved wide fame or notoriety
      - "Limited purpose" public figure: Voluntarily engaging in public controversy in an attempt to effect outcome
        - Gertz v Welsh
      - Gertz also tells you what to do with private figures
    - Private figures: Remedy cannot exceed actual damages, unless if actual malice is shown
  - Privacy
    - States may not prohibit publication of info already available in public records for
      privacy purposes (Cox broadcasting v Cone)
    - Even true if info obtained illegally (Bartnicki v Vopper)
  - Symbolic Speech
    - Conduct in or itself may be speech. Conduct that is expressive is protected
    - Gov't may regulate conduct, which may incidentally effects 1A speech and expression IF:
      (1) not related to suppression of free expression
      (2) there is substantial gov't interest
      (3) regulation narrowly tailored to achieve that interest
    - Case: O'Brien
    - When is infringing on speech incidental?
      - If law not directed at speech
      - Not the expressive element of action that the regulation hopes to prohibit
      - e.g if you're wearing armband, gov't more likely to be targeting that
        the speech that the armband is conveying rather than the fashion choices
  - Public forum
    - There are two ways something is public forum:
      (1) if it's a quintessential public forum (time immemorial; time sees fit by public
        for people to share their ideas)
        - Parks
        - Public streets
        - Case: Schneider, Hague v CIO
      (2) Designated public forums
        - When by its permitted use and designation, the gov't or other public actor
          has effectively designated it as a place of exchange of ideas and free speech
        - What designates a place:
          - Must be more than just public access:
            - Greer case: Roads leading into military base that were open to the public,
              but this was not enough for it to be a public forum even though the roads were public
            - Lehman case: Public transport with advertisements on it. Gov't tried to ban
              paid political ads; Court rejected argument that those ads were public forum.
              Gov't wasn't trying to create a public forum through its public transport.
              Advertising was just economic.
          - University in question (public university) opened spaces for student group
            meetings. Those are public meetings where people share ideas. Thus,
            those spaces become public forums (Widmar)
        - Case: Widmar
    - Rules if it is public forum
      - Gov't has a limited ability to restrict speech in a quintessential public forum
      - May only restrict in:
        (1) Regulation must be content-neutral
        (2) There must be alternate means of expression in that medium available
        (3) There is substantial gov't interest
        (4) Regulation is narrowly tailored
      - Case: US v Grace
        - Sidewalk outside of the Supreme Court
      - When regulating public forum: Time, manner, and place regulation is okay
    - If not public forum and the gov't regulated speech, it will use rational basis review
      - Cases: Lehman, Lee
      - Rational basis: If gov't have a logical rational reason, it is fine (deferential stance, i.e not very scrutinizing)
    - Any form of content-based regulation is presumptively unconstitutional,
      and must pass strict scrutiny (Reed v Town of Gilbert)
    - Gov't may only completely prohibit a medium of expression in a public forum if
      the regulation passes strict scrutiny (e.g leaflets) - US v Grace
  - Prior Restraint
    - Preventing or restraining the publication or issuance of speech or expression is
      almost never permissible
      - Pentagon Papers case: Show almost nothing imaginable constitutes substantial
        interest that justifies prior restraint
    - Extremely limited exception outlined in Neer v Minnesota: Disclosing the # and location of troops in wartime
  - Freedom of Press
    - Doctrines about the press
      (1) no constitutional right to the confidentiality of sources, though States may pass through own privileges permittingly
      (2) confidentiality of sources if only protected from gov't intervention when there is bad faith motivation
        (e.g gov't trying to mess with you and damage your ability to operate as member of press)
      (3) No right to confidential or inaccessible information that is not available to the public
        - Case: Branzberg for (2) and (3)
      (4) Constitutional right to access criminal trials
      (5) Differential treatment o fpress is not okay in the following:
        - If it singles out the press as an industry (Minneosta Star and Tribune)
        - If it targets a small group of speakers like newspaers (Minneosta Star and Tribune)
        - If it threatens to suppress particular viewpoints (Radcliffe)
        - If it discriminates on basis of content (Radcliffe)
      (6) Editorial control protected (Miami Herald)
      (7) Gov't regulation to improve the marketplace of ideas is generally not permissible under Miami Herald,
        but stuff like fairness doctrine in broadcasting is okay in (Red Lion) based on
        scarcity of airwaves
  - Political solicitation, expenditures, other activities
    - Regulation on individual or corporate contributions is permissible to prevent
      the appearance or reality of corruption, given that they are not so low as to
      make effective political advocacy impossible (Buckley v Valeo)
    - Regulation on expenditures are unconstitutional (Buckley)
    - Corporations can only be subjected to the same restrictions as individuals (Citizens United)
    - Aggregate contribution limits are unconstitutional (McCutcheon)
    - Prohibition on partisan speech on federal employees is okay (US Civil Service Commission v National Ass'n of Letter Carriers)
    - Adverse gov't action on employee's criticism  matters of public concern is NOT okay (Pickening)
    - Adverse govt action on employee's criticism matters NOT of public concern is okay (Connick)
    - Employment decisions based on political affiliation related to gov't employees in non policy making role
      is unconstituional (Elron)

What is the long answer response/policy question (last 20%)?
  - Type of question to expect (not a hypothetical):
    - Consider the two viewpoints:
      - Gov't argued that it could create new categories of unprotected speech
        based on balancing test that balances it with social cost, and then punished that category of speech
        based on its social cost
      - In considering application fo constitutional principles to new technologies, Court should
        understand new technology and see societal implications of this technology
        and not jump to conclusion that it's the same as before, and should not dismiss
        judgement of legislatures who assess implications of new technology.
        Should gov't be able to regulate the sales of VR programs in consistency with 1A?
  - When answering, use case law, underlying philosophy of 1A
    - Given one or two statements, and you need to write a response based on the
      prompt
  - Policy question asks you what are the reasons behind the law, are they good,
    what do you think the policy should look like: Underlines the way policy is
    or should be
  - Come to a conclusion, but make sure you looked at both sides
  - FSC readings are really relevant here
  - Spend most time on the issue tracker
  - Dive into the ideas as quickly as possible
    - Explain justification for your argument (case law, law itself)
