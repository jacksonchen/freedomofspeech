Packingham v North Carolina Case:
  - Question for the court: NC Statute stating that it is felony for sex offender
    to access social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. Is this permissible
    under 1A Free Speech clause?
  - Case: Packingham was a registered sex offender. After getting a traffic ticket
    dismissed, he posted on Facebook thanking God for that. Packingham never
    contacted a minor or committed any other illicit act on the Internet
  - North Carolina Supreme Court reversed Court of Appeals ruling, and stated that
    the law was constitutional
  - Court's decision: Reverses lower court ruling -- concludes statute violates 1A
  - Court's majority opinion:
    - Cyberspace is one of the most important spaces for exchanging views (Reno v ACLU)
      - Court acknowledges that "what they say today might be obsolete tomorrow"
    - The law must not "burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further
      the government's legitimate interests": The NC statute is way to broadly worded
      - State allowed to tailor laws to prohibit a sex offender from "engaging
        in conduct that often presages a sexual crime" (e.g contacting a minor
        on a website)
      - Government "may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful
        speech" (Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition)
    - NC hasn't proved that the law needs to be this broad to prevent sex offenders
      from vulnerable victims
      - Defense used the upholding of law banning demonstrating 100 ft from polling
        place, but in that situation demonstration is conflicting with another
        constitutional right -- the right to vote
  - Alito concurring judgement:
    - Agrees with majority opinion regarding the "law's extraordinary breadth"
      - Burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to further the
        government's legitimate interests
      - Blocks websites that are unlikely to facilitate commission of a sex crime
        against a child (e.g Amazon.com, news websites, WebMD)
    - Disagrees with majority that "equates the entirety of the internet with
      public streets and parks" -> definitely some website should be off limits
      - The Internet is harder for parents to monitor the activity of their children
      - Harder to see a sex offender approaching children on Internet than in real life
      - Internet offers "unprecendented degree of anonymity"
    - The NC law is a content-neutral restriction that serves a legitimate state
      interest -> the State's interest in protecting children from sex offenders
      online is legitimate

Davison v Randall
  - Case: Davison (a constituent) was banned from Randall's Facebook page. Davison
    attended a town hall where she implied School Board members acted unethically
    in financial transactions. Randall responded and said it was a set up question.
    Davison then posted in Twitter and Facebook to continue calling Randall out.
    Randall deleted posts that Davison commented negatively about and then banned
    Davison's SGP page he was commenting with. However, Randall unbanned 12 hours later.
    - Randall's Facebook page was designated as a politician page, and she used the
      page for as a public government information board
    - Davison is suing in regards to the banning (did not challenge the deletion
      of post)
  - Appeals Court affirmed district court ruling that Davison's 1A rights
    were violated
  - Court opinion:
    - Randall acted "under color of state law"
