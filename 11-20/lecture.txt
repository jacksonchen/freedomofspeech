Justifications for regulating broadcasting:
  - Scarcity doctrine (scarcity of spectrum allocation)
    - More people want to participate than there literally is space available
  - Makes use of a publicly owned space (Electromagnetic spectrum is public)
    - Broadcasting station requires utilizing that public space
  - Broadcasting is an extremely dangerous medium
    - People won't think clearly if this medium is co-opted

Scarcity argument -- everything is scarce
  - Markets deal with scarcity
    - For communication and speech, there is an even stronger impulse to use the market
      to allocate resources (idea of 1A was keeping the government out of regulating the
      market)
  - What was unique about the Red Lion case (that broadcast medium needs regulation):
    - Unanimous decision
    - ACLU and newspaper organizations argued in favor of government regulation of broadcasting
    - Hint in the case that it's a constitutional obligation of the government to regulate

Dialogue behind why spectrum is special
  - Arguments for why spectrum is special: Broadcast Spectrum is super scarce -- more than your usual scarcity
  - Counterargument: Newspapers are even more scarce (newspapers v publishing stations in various cities)
  - Response: The reason behind the scarcity of the newspaper market isn't the physical limitation,
    but actual economies of scale in the market that led to a monopoly
  - Response to that: Why does that even matter? Monopolization results in scarcity
  - The Court haven't responded to that last point

Regulation of broadcast spectrum
  - Fairness doctrine: If media talks about issue of public importance, then the
    broadcaster needs to present (or give opportunity) to give a counterpoint on
    that issue
  - Could the fairness doctrine apply to advertisements?
    - Particularly around cigarette advertisements
    - DC Court of Appeals case held that the fairness doctrine required counterpoints
      to be aired with cigarette ads
    - Cigarette companies lobbying for Congress to pass a law banning television advertising
      of cig companies, and it did
  - Bollinger's thesis of the Dual System of Freedom of Press
    - One of them is totally free, despite being subject to enormous amount of wealth (the press)
    - Another is regulated, in order to improve the discussion (the broadcast media)
  - Cable
    - Better offerings for rural communities
    - More efficient for urban environment
    - Expanded because you can get more channels than broadcast medium
    - Cable companies claimed they could not be regulated because they were different from
      broadcasting (200 channels on cable)
    - Arguably, cable is worse than broadcast, since there were 3 TV stations, but only
      one cable company in a geography
    - But the Supreme Court (Turner case, etc) said each technology has to be treated
      differently, and they saw cable between print and broadcasting, thus giving
      cable more protection from government but still some regulation
    - This is the current state of cable
  - The Internet
    - ...
  - Freedom of speech and press has historically been seen in the context of the
    nation (i.e the US). This idea is breaking down
    - Interdependence between nations of "profound significance"
    - Free speech and press needs to be thought in a global context now
