Case: Rally in Central Park to support abortion rights. The crowd is super
  supportive of the speaker. A guy comes up to the group, 30 feet away and yells:
  "You're a bunch of fucking bloody murderers". Is this speech protected by
  the 1A?

*Always ask what the relevant cases are*

Argument that speech is protected:
  - Cohen v California:
      - Cohen wore a jacket with "Fuck the draft" written on the back.
      - There was no threat or engagement of violence.
      - It was at a courthouse (i.e a public building/space), outside the courtroom.
      - There were children around
      - Arrested under California statute for disrupting the peace and quiet via
        offensive conduct

      - Court held that CA cannot prosecute Cohen for this context
        - Held that this was not an obscenity case (note: obscenity is an exception to 1A),
          because it must have an erotic element to it (which this case doesn't)
        - Cohen was not directing it towards anyone in particular
        - Pure vulgarity that isn't directed is perfectly fine, i.e protected by 1A:
          Harlan's majority opinion in Cohen case: "One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric"

What we know about the 1A
  - Restraining applies to federal and state actors
  - Applies to public spaces
  - Exception for libel
  - Exception for obscene speech
  - Exception for fighting words
  - Other "obvious" exceptions
    - Securities law and insider trading, etc
    - Premeditating murder

Subsequent cases to Cohen (fighting words doctrine)
  - Personally insulting words are not exempt from 1A protection

Why did the Court rule that vulgarities are okay?
  - Slippery slope argument: We don't have a good way of drawing a line without
    running an unacceptable risk that it would lead to further speech restrictions
    that we do find acceptable
  - Human nature that people in power want to destroy all contrary beliefs

  Burger's mission is to formulate an obscenity test -- more specific
    but allows greater prosecution
