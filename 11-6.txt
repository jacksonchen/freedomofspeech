Case: Reporter for WaPo, reports on foreign affairs, national security, and the
  White House. Received a verbatim transcript of a Trump convo with Erdogan,
  where Trump asks: "By the way, need a favor: want you to investigate Biden fam,
  and it's also okay if you go into Syria, push the Kurds back, and take it over with Russia".
  Erdogan says sure. Lots of emails and docs show how we will withdraw, will happen to Kurds

Would journalist do?
  - Ask WH and Erdogan for a comment to see their response
    - President says he want to use every means within constitutional power to
      give explicit instructions to AG Barr (to fight this article)
    - Recall someone in gov't leaked this to reporter. The way in which this leak
      even happened may change what the gov't can do vis-a-vis the newspapers
  - Can leaker be prosecuted? What can the government do here:
    - Unclear by probably yes, leaker has no 1A claim
    - Could prosecute the reporter that it is a person soliciting a crime

Pentagon Papers case
  - Court held that government cannot have a *prior restraint* to prosecute
    - Decision was limited because a law wasn't passed by Congress authorizing
      the injunction
    - The result is actually potentially very narrow (the papers themselves were
      not that dangerous)
  - Test from the case:
    - Did publication know about classified information
    - Harm to national security
    - Not contribute to the public
  - Supreme Court refused government request to enjoin the NYT and WaPo from
    publishing a several volume history of how the US went into the Vietnam war

  - Prior restraint
    - Could be through a centralized board that can reject materials from publication,
      or just an injunction against publication
    - Near v Minnesota
      - Strong presumption against constitutionality of prior restraint
      - Added injunctions against publication to this category of prior restraint

Making the case it's constitutional to prosecute publication of something
  - How to show that the Pentagon Papers case is irrelevant here
    - Congressional Act -> not in the Papers case (that was only around executive action)
    - Claim that it's fresh new territory from the Papers case, try to limit that case
    - Claim that the Pentagon Papers case is super narrow and that the publication
      here has legitimate harm to the government
  - What would newspapers respond?
    - Say Pentagon Papers had broader implications about an ethos in society
    - Press has an important role to play against government secrecy
  - How is the world today different from the time when Pentagon Papers was decided?
    - Information access today is significantly simpler
    - Leaking is much more vast in scope (the risk of harmful information getting out
      are much greater)
