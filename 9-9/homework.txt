Constitutional Law
  Abrams v US
    - Facts
      - Self described socialists from Russia distributed leaflets to call for a
        general strike
      - Convicted of conspiring to violate the Espionage Act of 1917
    - Trial judge stated: "The only thing they know how to raise is hell, and
      to direct it against the government of the United States." (1352)
    - Supreme Court affirmed the convictions on (1) conspiracy "to incite, provoke
      or encourage resistance to the United States", (2) conspiracy to urge
      curtailment of the production of war materials
    - Justice Holmes dissented stating that the "defendants did not have the
      intent, required by the act, to cripple or hinder the United States in
      the prosecution of the war" (1353).
      - "The defendants' specific intent, Justice Holmes maintained, was to
        help Russia, with whom we were not at war" (1353)
      - The intent statute must take words in strict and accurate sense, otherwise
        it would criminalize the statement "we were wasting money on aeroplanes" as
        curtailing US war effort
      - Doesn't see how the leaflet aims to impede the United States in a war it
        was carrying on -- only to prevent American intervention in Russia
      - Also thinks that you can't stop all leaflets against the US, and only
        ones that pose an "immediate threat" need to be stopped; these guys are
        too small and anonymous to pose any real threat regardless
      - Marketplace of ideas

    Whitney v California
      - Whitney was part of the Communist Labor Party, whose convention she sponsored
        a moderate resolution calling for a electoral means of achieving goals
      - At trial, she testified it was not her intention for the CLP to be "an
        instrument of terrorism or violence"
      - Argued that the Syndicalism Act was an unreasonable exercise of the police
        power of the State, and the court denied that
      - Brandeis' opinion
        - "This court has no yet fixed the standard by which to determine when a
          danger shall be deemed clear" (1365-66) -> for now leave to the legislature
        - "Every denunciation of existing law tends in some measure to increase the
          probability that there will be violation of it"
        - "Public discussion is a political duty" and "the greatest menace to freedom
          is an inert people"
        - "The wide difference between advocacy and incitement between preparation and
          attempt, must be borne in mind" (1367)
        - Mere voluntary assembly for a syndicate should be constitutionally protected,
          and it can only be stopped on grounds that there is a high probability
          of serious injury to the state -> must display a sense of clear danger,
          and if it was imminent in order to justify the stringent restriction
          interposed by the legislature.
      - Consequences
        - Persuasion principle (gov't may not suppress speech bc it is persuasive)
        - Association in an org can be blocked, not even participating in activity
        - Clear and present danger was the hallmark test during this period

    Dennis v US
      - Petitioners were indicted for violation of conspiracy of the Smith Act
      - It was argued that the Communist Party was a threat to the United States gov't
      - Court opinion:
        - "We are squarely presented with the application of the clear and present danger
          test, and must decide what that phrase imports"
        - The gov't may not act until such action is "about to be executed", regardless
          of how powerful or weak the rebellion would be
      - Justice Frankfurter
        - "To make validity of legislation depend on judicial reading of events still
          in the womb of time is to charge the judiciary with duties beyond
          its equipment"
      - Justice Jackson: Supported conviction (despite talking about "letting off steam")
      - Dissent
        - Justice Black: Does not believe that Communism as an idea is inherently
          about overthrowing the US government, and believes that "benefits derived
          from free expression were worth the risk".
        - Justice Douglas: "If the books themselves are not outlawed, if they can
          lawfully remain on library shelves, by what reasoning does their use become
          a crime?" Does not believe that Communists as a political party have any
          significant consequence, and thus do not pose a "clear and present danger"
      - Consequences
        - "Gravity" dilutes the standard of "clear and present danger"
        - Deference: If legislature expressly prohibits a certain category of
          expression, the judiciary must defer to the legislative judgement so long as
          it is reasonable
        - Contemporarily, the decision is seen as a mistake as there was no proof
          that Dennis was planning on overthrowing the US government
        - Yates v US -- The judges narrowed down the Smith Act so federal prosecutors
          couldn't charge anyone affiliated with CPUSA: "Advocacy of action"
          vs "advocacy of belief"

    Brandenburg v Ohio
      - A KKK member who was charged on Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Statute
        (that was virtually the same as California's that took down Whitney)
      - Ohio's syndicate law was struck down because it targeted mere advocacy
      - Justices Douglas and Black denounced the "clear and present danger test",
        as it turned the Dennis case into a political case
      - Consequences
        - This case was a contrary application compared to the Espionage Act
          and Communist cases
        - Required (1) express advocacy of law violation, (2) advocacy must call
          for immediate law violation and (3) the immediate law violation must be
          likely to occur
        - Most stringent protections of the 1A for its time
        - Effects learned by the Court:
          - Chilling effect: Individual speakers gain very little by exercising free speech
          - Pretext effect - Gov't officials will defend their restrictions of speech
            on grounds quite different from their real motivations for suppression
          - Crisis effect - During times of crisis, people rush to suppress speech
            they demonize as dangerous/treasonable
      - Later cases: "Mere advocacy of the use of force does not remove speech
        from the protection of the First Amendment"
      - Last 30 years since Brandenberg, not many changes to 1A cases
        - Holder v Humanitarian Law Project
          - Plaintiffs maintained that their speech advanced only the legitimate
            activities of the designated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism
          - Robert and the Court upheld that they were giving "material support"
            to terrorists
          - Roberts made clear that gov't couldn't regulate independent speech even
            if it benefitted foreign terrorist organizations

  Other questions
    - Forced Disclosure does not violate the First Amendment
    - Petitioners have a constitutional right to talk politics, but no constitutional
      right to be a policeman
    - A blanket prohibition of association with a group with both legal and illegal
      aims suppressed 1A
    - Colleges may not restrict speech or association of student groups because
      it finds the views expressed by any group to be abhorrent
    - Military rights are different from civilian rights

Free Speech Century
  - Every possible use of language?
    - 1919: Schenck v US case created the "clear and present danger" test
    - Frohwerk case
      - Prosecuted under Espionage Act for editorials sympathizing with resistance
        to the draft. Sentenced to 10 years in prison.
      - Holmes concluded that the newspaper was enough to kindle a flame
    - Holmes started the "rational basis" test for laws, where the Court would no
      longer act as a "super-legislature" and instead just check for rational basis
      against the Constitution -> The main exception to this is 1A, where instead
      of checking against "rationality", "clear and present" is used
    - Speech is not just spoken words
      - Holmes authored many other cases that restricted speech, even though 1A
        was never brought up in those cases
      - Where does this stop? Insider trading? Food labeling?
      - It can't be applied everywhere because then it won't be as effective in political
        situations where it actually matters (dilution concerns): "We are uncertain
        about the effects of a substantial broadening of the coverage of the First
        Amendment, with one possibility being that such broadening will bring increased
        protection for speech only remotely related to the core principles of
        freedom of speech" (46)
      - Question of coverage needs to be separate from question of protection
  - Does Clear and Present Danger survive cost-benefit analysis
    - Regulatory state has become cost-benefit state: if benefits would justify
      the cost of regulation (the expected value of proceeding)
      - Alternative is Precautionary Principle, where no cost-benefit since
        precautions will actually eliminate harm
    - Welfarist approach: Eliminate the speech that would actually pose harm,
      or has costs that exceed the benefits. But this prevents speech against the unjust status quo.
    - Other approaches
      - Counterspeech: Required a showing of imminence, rather than use cost-benefit
        "If there is time to avert the evil through discussion, then the
        remedy is not forced silence, but counterspeech" (168)
      - Likelihood: In Brandenburg, "clear" meant "likely"
    - Defending likelihood and imminence (clear and present danger test)
      - Quantification is difficult (hence cost-benefit is not feasible)
        - How do you define the benefit of a speech??
      - Risk of institutional bias
        - Government will always have its own self interests in mind,
          cost-benefit analysis is really easy to manipulate
      - The test has held convincing during the time it has held sway
