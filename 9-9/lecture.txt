Case: A person is angry about alumni legacy at Columbia, and gives a speech
  at Columbia. Eventually he calls for a public takeover of the president's
  office. University security comes up, tells him to stop, and is later
  expelled by the university.

"Clear and present danger" shows that this speech is protected (assuming Columbia
must abide by 1A)
  - Schenck and Debs came up during a time of war and time of panic, so the current
    case is not comparable to those cases
  - The circumstance here is a LOT less significant and risky than dodging
    draft during such a time, the Court has deference to situation
  - The importance is to distinguish between this case and those cases

How the Courts understand the case is what matters the most, not what the lawyer thinks
  - The question is is the expulsion valid, not is the speech protected by 1A
  - For any case, question if 1A even applies at all

The 1919 cases hold the in certain circumstances, the State may punish you
(including putting you in jail) for doing nothing more than giving a speech
about a political problem
  - If there is a clear and present danger that the government has the right to prevent
  - In this case it was to prevent and interfere with the conscription

What is the scope/applicability of 1A? Does it apply to a private university?
  - Courts made it clear 1A doesn't just apply to Congress, but to the entire
    federal gov't (even though the clause explicitly says Congress)
  - Bill of Rights only applies to fed gov't, and not to the States
  - Is 1A applicable to states? From Gitlow and hence forth, yes.
  - But 1st and 14th amendment do NOT apply to private actions.

Columbia receives ~$500M-1B from the federal government for research
  - Chartered by the state
  - Receives tax-benefits for being education affiliated
  - However, Columbia still isn't considered a "state actor". Berkeley,
    on the other hand would be considered a state actor.

Schaeffer is the lower Court case that governed 1A doctrine until 1919
  - If gov't can show that speech has bad tendency to lead people to commit
    illegal acts, then the speech is not protected
  - The "clear and present danger" test is much more favorable to a speaker
    than the "bad tendency" test from before

In Masses case, Judge Learned Hand made legal liability test
  - If you explicitly call to violate the law, then you won't be protected.
    He knows that this is overprotective of the gov't, but he also knows that
    if the citizen knows what to avoid, then the citizen will *always* be protected
  - Difference with Holmes' test: Hand's test is easier to determine if the
    law has been broken rather than "clear and present danger"
  - Hand's logic is that "clear and present danger" is filled with prejudice,
    so he needed a precise and clear test. He does not want people to NOT
    give speech, and to remove any opaqueness around 1A so people are more
    willing to give speeches.

  Applying Learned Hand's test to Bollinger's case:
    - Learned Hand would indict Bollinger because Hand's test is that
      speech is protected until someone says it's the duty to violate the law
    - Arguing against Hand's test would be: "there was proof that there
      was no chance the law would have been broken"
