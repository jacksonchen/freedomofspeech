Advocacy vs Inciting -- kind of question we should be asking
Brandenberg is where Modern 1A Theory begins
Final exam -- hypothetical case, figure out all the possible arguments
  - Consider stare decisis and implications that a future court is bound by your decision

When to use dissenting opinions
  - If a previous case doesn't apply or make sense (i.e needs to be overturned),
    then the dissenting opinion is often referred to in the current case

=========
Case: White Nationalist Group speaking at a big public venue saying hateful things.
    Protestors gather at the back of the hall, create noise and disturbance.
    Eventually, the speaker says "let's take them down, show them what we feel",
    the supporters start to storm the protesters. The police arrest those engaging in the assaults and also arrest
    the speaker.

    Speaker is arrested for inciting violence (speaking in a way that cause supporters
    to engage in illegal behavior).

Argument: Speech is protected
  - Immediately begin with Brandenberg, speech isn't protected unless
    (1) Intent, imminence, and likelihood
  - "Imminent immediate" in Brandenberg drew from Learned Hand's "express, explicit incitement",
    in this case, "let's take them down" was NOT explicit
    - Just an explicit call for violence still protected by 1A
    - Explicitly makes it effectively impossible to prosecute a case

Argument: Speech is not protected
  - "Let's take them down" while the crowd is ready to attack is by definition a call
    for imminent lawless action that is likely
  -

Why so much emphasis in 1A?
  Holmes' opinion in Abrams
    - Free marketplace of ideas
    - If you're interested in the truth, you will have to protect speech that is seen as bad
  Mill's theory
    - Even if something is definitively not true, it's important to allow people to
      speak the falsehoods to keep what I believe alive
  Democracy
  Ability to speak is a human right, no need for it to be justified

Brandeis Brief - Putting things in social and national context, the law/argument will be more persuasive
