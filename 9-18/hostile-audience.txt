Speech that Provokes a Hostile Audience Reaction
  - To what extent does 1A protect speaker whose expression provokes a "breach of peace"?
  - Terminiello v Chicago
    - Terminiello convicted of disorderly conduct while giving speech to 800 people
      (there were 1000 protesters outside). His speech caused members of the crowd
    - Jury instructed to convict if found his speech included expression that
      "stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, ..."
    - The Court found this instruction violated 1A. Speech is meant to invite dispute
  - Cantwell v Connecticut
    - Cantwell played a phonograph record on the street that attacked Catholicism
      to people he met on the street
      - Hearers were highly offended
      - He was charged with inciting a breach of the peace
    - Court found that provocative language that breached peace consisted of
      "profane, indecent, or abusive remarks directed to the person of the hearer"
      - In his case, Cantwell didn't threaten personal abuse, bodily harm, etc
      - Exaggeration/falsification is okay
      - He was also in a public street, and asked for permission to play the phonograph
      - Court overturned his conviction
    - "When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon
      the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order,
      appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious"
  - Feiner v New York
    - Petitioner was making a speech to a mixed race crowd deriding public officials,
      and also telling black people to rise up to fight for their rights
      - Police officer told him to stop 3 times, petitioner refused, then was arrested
    - Convicted for breach of peace
    - Court majority opinion: This situation constitutes "clear and present danger
      of riot", thus the conviction is affirmed
    - Justice Black (dissent): Doesn't believe the crowd's action constituted a
      risk to riot/disorder.
      - "I reject the implication of the Court's opinion that the police had no
        obligation to protect petitioner's constitutional right to talk"
      - Police before interfering with lawful public speaker must make "reasonable
        efforts to protect him"
      - "Petitioner was entitled to know why he should cease doing a lawful act.
        Not once was he told"
    - Future cases
      - Edwards v South Carolina: Black students walked in public State House grounds
        to protest racial inequality. Police arrested them.
      - Court overturned the conviction, stating that it "was a far cry" from Feiner
      - "A far cry" from Feiner might serve to limit the precedential force of Feiner
  - Chaplinsky v New Hampshire
    - A member of Jehovah's Witnesses was convicted for violating a law that
      stated that no one should offend or deride others on the street
      - He was doing this on a busy Saturday afternoon, and the police officers claim
        that a riot was imminent
    - The Court opinion: Fighting words "whose very utterence inflict injury or tend
      to incite an immediate breach of peace" are not protected
      - The New Hampshire statute "does no more than prohibit the face-to-face" words
        plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee ->
        covers fighting words, profanity, obscenity, and threats
      - "We are unable to say that the limited scope of the statute as thus
        construed contravenes the Constitutional right of free expression"
    - '"Damned racketeer" and "damned Fascist" are epithets likely to provoke the
      average person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace'
    - The Court affirmed the conviction

What are fighting words?
  - "Fighting words are unprotected because as "epithets or personal abuse,"
    they are intended to inflict harm rather than to communicate ideas, and
    thus are not really "speech" at all
  - Burning a flag
    - Street v New York: Burning a flag is not fighting words, thus constitutionally
      protected: "not likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby
      cause a breach of the peace"
    - Texas v Johnson: Texas statute banning flag burning that offends others was
      ruled unconstitutional since "this expressive conduct" did not fall within
      the fighting words doctrine ("no reasonable onlooker would have regarded
      ... as a direct personal insult")
  - Cohen v California: Cohen wore a jacket with "Fuck the Draft" in a courthouse.
    Court ruled that Cali statute that his jacket created a bad tendency to
    provoke others to acts of violence did NOT apply. This is bc it is "clearly not
    directed to the person of the hearer. No individual actually or likely to
    be present could reasonably have regarded the words on appellant's
    jacket as a direct personal insult" (1416)
  - Couple other cases (e.g Gooding v Wilson) where state statutes against
    abusive and profane language were ruled unconstitutional by 1A
  - **Court has not upheld a conviction on basis of fighting words since Chaplinsky

Hate Speech
  - Skokie v Nationalist Socialist Party of America
    - Nazi's trying to march in a town of Jewish survivors won their right to march
      there due to 1A
    - They ultimately marched in Chicago (25 people) with 400 police officers
      defending them
  - Snyder v Phelps
    - Westboro Baptist Church protested at a gay soldiers' funeral. The father (Snyder)
      sued for emotional distress. The Court affirmed they were protected
      by 1A, since they were protesting about topics of national significance.
    - The Court stated that you can't determine emotional distress based on "outrageousness",
      which the lower court used to hold them liable, since it's allows "a jury to
      impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps
      on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression"
    - Alito's dissent: He noted that there are plenty of other ways Westboro Church
      could have express their discontent, but they may not "inflict severe emotional
      injury on private persons at a time of intense emotional sensitivity by launching
      vicious verbal attacks that make no contribution to public debate"

Court overturned municipal rule that had permitting fees for assemblies, speakers:
  "Speech cannot be financially burdened"
