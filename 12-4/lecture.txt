Case: FCC is looking to ban all political advertisements in the world of TV
  and radio. This includes political advertisements on any political issues.

  - Campaign finance cases are relevant in this situation
  - Arguments that expenditures of money for politics is a form of corruption
    - There are extremely limited restrictions for contributions because of
      political quid pro quo
    - There is also the theory of distortion of public debate -- people with extreme
      wealth have disproportionate access to the public forum, and thus their ideas
      have greater influence on public debate and the public mind
    - Buckley v Valeo drew the distinction between contributions and expenditures
    - Over the next 30 years, Supreme Court has loosened and allowed more and more
      regulation
    - Conservative majority in Citizens United culled all of the previous 30 years
      back and backed a strong line on Buckley v Valeo
      - Tackled the question of if corporate speech is protected (and it was determined
        yes by overruling the Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce case)
  - However, a ban on ads is more than just campaign finance
    - Red Lion case (and Miami Herald)
      - Issue: Can the government impose on broadcasters, an obligation to be fair
        in the discussion of public issues? (i.e must present the other side when
        bringing up an argument for one side of the issue)
      - Court said this was constitutional because of the scarcity of the broadcasting
        spectrum. No allocation system and allowing everyone to communicate will
        lead to chaos.
      - Court cares that the public is informed and presented with other views,
        and broadcasters have overwhelming amount of power in swaying the public forum
      - Bringing back to our case on hand: Internet has expanded the public forum
        significantly, and also undermines the problem that there were too few people
        who were able to voice their opinions. On the other hand, the Internet has
        created a world where people don't have to encounter other view points (echo chambers).
      - Scarcity rationale is presented as if it is a distinguishing feature from other
        technologies of communication. It portrays broadcasting as somehow different
        from everything else (e.g print) and thus justifying gov't intervention.
        (Court shut down intervention in print medium in the Miami Herald case)
    - FCC v Pacifica
      - Banning indecent speech, LIMITING speech on the airwaves like how banning
        political advertisements limits speech on the airwaves as well
      - However, the FCC rule on OUR hands will limit speech because it is content-based,
        and also limits wealthy people from being able to express speech, thus
        it is likely unconstitutional
  - What is the difference between this FCC rule banning all political advertisements
    and the Red Lion fairness doctrine?
    - Red Lion is about gov't intervention to expand speech
    - This FCC rule is about gov't intervention to decrease (e.g limiting) speech
      - This makes this case similar to FCC v Pacifica (see above)
      - Eliminating speech tends to be worse than expanding speech
  Concept of limiting speech to promote equality in speech
    - Bollinger says it is inconsistent with 1A
    - However, government having some role in the marketplace of ideas to shift
      the balance of power is not unprecedented -> FCC fairness doctrine in Red Lions case
