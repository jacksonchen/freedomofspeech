Case: Zuckerberg testifies before Congress where is he going to be challenged
  for why they allow political advertisements with false statements. Zuckerberg
  wants to argue why Facebook should continue to allow false ads.

Argument that false ads are constitutional
  - NYT v Sullivan, where NYT is a private company and it is allowed to run misleading
    statements
  - Public forum doctrine
    - Case: Hague v CIO
    - Facebook v public time doctrine: Not time immemorial, also Facebook content
      is not government hosted
  - If someone is a public figure and use their public figure status to create a
    public forum, are they obligated under public forum doctrine to make it an open forum?
    - Trump and his Twitter feed
  - Organizations that are private and by definition not state actor have the power
    to organize speech however well they wish. Is there a way to reconceptualize this credence?
    - e.g some private activity becomes so important for free speech that we
      will treat that as state action or speech
    - Marsh v Alabama: But this is fairly rare
    - Shopping mall, but justices have started to back away from this
    - People can argue that Facebook is so powerful that for First Amendment purposes,
      that it can be treated as a state actor
      -> where Facebook cannot discriminate on the basis of content; they must
        allow hate speech and neo-Nazis to come speak
    - NYT case resolved a small sliver of situations that allowed for some civil action by public officials
      under certain conditions, and not an overarching case on public forum

Case: Supposed Congress tells Zuckerberg that he cannot decide these questions on
  speech on Facebook's platform, so they will pass laws to restrict his power
  - If Zuck tells Congress they can't do that, he can back himself up with the
    Miami Herald v Tornillo case
    - Florida law stated that if candidate for office is critiqued in the newspaper,
      they should have the similar amount of column space to respond
    - The Court held that editing is what editors are for, and that it is not
      the business of the government to tell newspapers what can be on their pages
    - That case was unanimous; that law seems utterly inconsistent with the
      way we think about freedom of speech and press
  - How would Congressional lawyers respond to the Miami Herald case?
    - They would respond with Red Lion Broadcasting v FCC case
    - Court said gov't absolutely had the right to regulate the content of a publisher,
      in this case a broadcast; Court argued that it was imperative for the government
      to intervene
    - Also unanimous decision
    - Law that is in issue with Red Lion is the FCC's fairness doctrine regulations
      - Goes back to Radio Act 1927
  - Today 1934 Communications Act is still in place, which set up the FCC to regulate
    broadcasting radio & television in accordance with public interest, convenience and necessity
    - Requiring radio licenses are like prior restraint of the public forum
    - Fairness doctrine: Allows FCC to restrict speech on various intrusive levels
      - If you attack a person, you have to allow that person to respond within a certain period of time
      - Rules on political advertising for political candidates as well
    - FCC v Pacifica: Prohibition on indecency during daylight hours
  - What does Court say about restriction of broadcasting that is consistent with 1A?
    - Not everyone can speak on radio (signal chaos if everyone is broadcasting at once),
      thus classic 1A principles cannot apply here
    - In order to allow radio medium to be viable as a communications medium, it has to
      be allocated (there are more people who want to speak than the medium could possibly
      support); thus those who get the special privilege of communicating on this medium
      should not get the special powers that come with that to propel their own opinions
      at the exclusion of others
    - Counterargument: Everything is scarce, land, ink that goes into newspapers, etc
      thus there should not be a special exception for the scarcity of radio spectrum;
      the way we allocate scarcity is through the market
      - Counter to this counterargument in Red Lions case: Radio spectrum needs to
        still be a place with multiple points of view
  - Industry:
      Newspapers have been a monopoly business in cities even before the Internet
      There were probably 3-4 TV channels per community
      Maybe a dozen radio stations per community/city
    - Why were monopolistic newspapers afforded more protection from the government
      compared to radios?
      - There was a way to set up a broadcasting station that did not involve seeking
        government approval (i.e the market)
