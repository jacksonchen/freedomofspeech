====== State vs Federal Law ======

Federal Court System
  District Courts -- Geographic jurisdiction, generally at least one per state
    - Create records of the facts
  Circuit Courts -- Appellate Court, 13 circuits across the country
    - Also regional jurisdiction (the California circuit rulings will not
      apply to the East Coast)
    - If different Circuits come to different decisions, then it's called a
      split decision
  Supreme Courts -- Also Appellate Court

  - Limited jurisdiction (only limited to Constitution and federal statutes)
    - Federal question
    - Diversity (issue amongst multiple states)

State Court System
  - General jurisdiction
  - Can still decide questions at the federal level, appeals from the
    State Supreme Court would go directly to the Supreme Court

Appellate Cases
  - Facts given in cases in appellate courts are the plain facts, no more
    fact gathering needed
  - Does the law apply, and how so?

Institutional role of morality
  What judges can do
    - Who wins, and why?
    - Announce (and create new) law
      - Creates **precedent**
        - This is an internal constraint for judges -- they have to behave
          according to certain principles & norms, otherwise they would be
          charged with making stuff up
        - However, when there is no precedent (1919 1A cases), the judges
          effectively have to make stuff up
    - Supreme Court can come up with tests, but new fact patterns will always change
      - e.g First Amendment -- What counts as speech? Especially with new media
    - What they use to make decisions
      - Constitutional Text
      - Precedent, history
      - Philosophy & common sense (don't seem to matter that much in Constitutional
        law)
    - 1A since 1970, not much free-floating philosophizing (already have huge
      body of case law) -- huge emphasis on precedent & case law
    - If there's new fact patterns -- need to analogize facts with previous cases
      and beholding to general principle
    - Whenever you make an argument, you are expected to provide reasons for why
      you are right. Legal argument is limited because of case law, statutes,
      Constitution, the history, etc

  What activists can do
    - Even more limited than a judge, since you're trying to convince them
      that based on stuff they said, you're right
    - Anticipating your opponent and their reasoning (and why it's wrong)

Civil law vs Common law
  - Common law -- past judicial precedent and rulings affect the ruling at hand
    - UK, US, Australia
  - Civil law -- certified ordinances that govern the land (i.e precedent is
    not as important)
    - Most of Europe, Africa, South America (except Guyana), Japan, China

Stare Decisis
  - Settled expectations as a reliance for a stable system
  - Having consistent and predictable development of labeled principles
    - When precedent is often overturned, then it makes everyone confused
    - If cornerstone case is overruled, a lot of new laws and statutes have
      to be made
  - Requires precedent to be followed
  - All states and lower courts are bound by Supreme Court decisions

Importance of precedent
  - Judges cannot overturn precedent just because they don't like it
  - By adhering to precedent, it limits the power of the judiciary esp in
    very politically testing times
  - What are the good reasons to overturn precedent?
    - Circumstances that the original decision was made is indefensible
    - The original decision was clearly "wrong"
    - It should *not* be the law of the land
    - It's causing a lot of harm to a group or certain groups
    - The precedent is simply unworkable (not an effective way to continue
      forward in making a body of case law)
    - Or the precedent has been eroded by subsequent decisions

How to make legal arguments
  - Simplest form: Have the law, apply it to a set of facts, and this yields an outcome
  - Example: Illegal to rob a bank; Sarah robbed a bank; Sarah broke the law

  - How to show what the law is
    - Constitution (text or various forms of interpretation)
    - Statutes (laws passed by a Congressional body either state or federal level)
    - Precedent (old cases)
      - A lot of rules aren't found in statutes and the Constitution (e.g
        "clear and present danger" rule)
  - When making an assertion of the law, make sure to cite the relevant authority
  - The holding
    - Def: The pithy statement of what the case says
    - e.g: "Clear and present danger" rule is the holding of that case
  - Applying the rule/law to the case
    - Reasoning by analogy: In case x the Court found that someone borrowing things
      and forgot to return them is a clear and present danger; since Sarah's case
      is very similar to that, thus the outcome should be the same
    - Why reasoning matters
      - e.g A house is a dwelling if you live there for a significant period of time
      - What is a significant period of time?
        - Case A says 30 days is not significant bc it's a typical vacation time-length
  - Use holdings, facts, and underlying reasoning to make the case
  - Stylistically, keep the argument simple and concise

Case Brief
  - Summary of the case, generally subjective
  - Includes key facts, procedural posture, holding, and other major takeaways
    - Name of the case and what court the case was in + time
    - Key facts (what facts are legally relevant)
    - Procedural history (procedural posture)
      - What courts has the case been through
      - What did the lower courts find and what basis
      - What kind of relief has been granted?
    - Issue and holding
    - Reasoning (why the court decided the case it did, will be used for future
      fact patterns)
    - Dissents/concurrences: Not binding law, but a good basis for policy arguments
      or distinguishing future cases
  - e.g Masses Publishing Co v Patten
    - Passes (Plaintiff) produced the revolutionary journal "The Masses",
      which included satire ...
    - Patten (Defendant) is the Postmaster general who wanted to limit the distribution
      of the journal
    - P applied for a preliminary injunction to forbid D from refusing to
      issue their journal in the August issue
    - D objected that Masses violated the Espionage Act of 1917
    - Issue: Was P entitled to a preliminary injunction, or did D have authority
      to prohibit its mailing under Espionage Act of 1917 (Should hostile
      criticism ever be tolerated in our system of gov't)
    - Holding (Hand): Yes, P is entitled to a preliminary injunction. i.e hostile
      criticism is okay as long as ...
    - Reasoning: Arousing anti-war sentiment may be insubordination, but a
      broad reading of the Act to prohibit such political agitation would
      suppress all hostile criticism. As long as one stops short of urging
      upon others that is their duty or interest to resist the law, one should
      not be held to have attempted to cause its violation
    - Aftermath: Hand's opinion was reversed and Masses was driven out of business
      and editors prosecuted under Espionage Act. But Hand's opinion influenced
      many free speech cases to come
  - One brief per case

Citations
  - <Case Name>, <Volume No> <Reporter Abbrev> <1st Page of case>, <Pinpoint> (<Court> <Decision Year>)
  - Plaintiff comes first, however in appellate cases, the defendant could be
    the petitioner, etc
  - Pinpoint is the page you actually refer to
  - If the Court isn't in the geographic jurisdiction of the case, then this citation
    is likely used as persuasion rather than as set law
    - Don't need the Court name if the reporter abbreviation is US (US Reports)
      or SC (Supreme Court Reports), since it is implied to be the Supreme Court
