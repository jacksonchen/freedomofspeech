What speech is legal vs illegal
  - Clear and present danger, also intent on behalf of speaker
    - Brandenberg: Who the speech is directed at (i.e intent)
  - It is IMPORTANT to note that intent factors in how we draw the line
  - In criminal law
    - To prosecute someone for a crime, you must prove intent (state of mind)
  - Espionage Act 1917
    - Criminal interferes with war conduct
    - Congress then passed a law saying that advocacy is illegal (not just doing the act)
      - Should the Courts give more deference to the law in rational judgement or in
        cases where the law does not expressly prohibit speech?
      - Argument for: Because the Court is a co-equal branch, their decisions should give
        deference to the other branches (this includes stuff like 1917 Espionage Act that
        only criminalizes behavior and has no mention of speech)
      - Secondary arg: The Court should only give deference to laws that explicitly call
        out speech or advocacy
        - This argument has not succeeded and is not followed in case law today

Make the case that Columbia should ban all hate speech (sexist, homophobic, antisemetic, etc)
  - The world is already deeply discriminatory to oppressed groups, adding free
    speech on this would add to that
  - These ideas and ways of thinking have done horrible things to these groups,
    and it is important for us to not think that way again
    - If "let's go back to be Nazis again" speech occur, this must be stopped
  - Emotional harm is legitimate -- this speech comes at a very high price
  - There was a period of time when the Supreme Court did not recognize the rights of hate speech
  - Going around the world, most democracies don't allow hate speech to occur.
    This shows there is a consensus outside of the US that hate speech goes too far.
    - Reflected in International Declaration of Human Rights, and other int'l documents & treaties
      -> They allow and express nations to prohibit hate speech
  - How to argue against the line-drawing argument? (that drawing lines introduces a slippery slope, etc)
    - Line drawing is always a problem, but 1A is filled with lines

  - Argument: When people are automatically harmed (violence possible bc it's so offensive)
    we allow the state to intervene in the speech
    - Counterargument: The Court has upheld the argument that you can just avert your eyes
      if something is so offensive to you

Case: At Columbia we want to voluntarily be consistent with 1A. Thus we want to ban fighting
  words that are racist and sexist. Since fighting words are not protected, we will
  ban *these* specific fighting words. Is this okay?

Argument against this rule
  - RAV case (RAV vs St Paul)
    - Judgement: A state cannot choose, on the basis of fighting words, to prohibit a narrow segment of fighting words
    - Gist of RAV: One area the Court is the most sensitive in regards to 1A is how the legislator
      or the State is choosing to interfere in the marketplace of ideas, and
      when it goes against a specific viewpoint (say a racist one), the Court
      will step in to prevent favoring one side of the argument over the other
    - Consequence of the case is that hate speech is protected
      - You can't choose to prohibit some hate speech based on some content or whatever
  - Cohen

Speech that is a personal directed threat is NOT protected by 1A
  - "I will kill you. Look out you have one day to live"

For Court to avoid completely striking down laws and slapping the other branch in the face,
  the Court may see words x as meant to be interpreted at y to avoid confronting x
  as unconstitutional, and hence reinterpreting the statute
    - Example: Hands' Masses cases. He was interpreting the Espionage Act to the
      Post Office and trying to discern what was the legislative intent in enacting that
      law.
    - His argument was he didn't believe Congress wanted to create a prohibition on speech
      that would undermine all opinion in a functioning democracy, so thus he
      interpreted it differently (without striking it down)
    - In essence, it was just him interpreting the statute, even though it wrote
      the rules for how 1A operated

Case: WaPo runs an article: "Donald Trump Jr uses cocaine daily". Legal advice before running story
  - Writer's proof: Received an anonymous call from a voice that sounded trustworthy and facts
    that seem to add up.
  - Writer is doing this solely to make a profit

  Argument for running this
    - NYT v Sullivan
      - If target of the speech is a public figure, the speech is protected even
        though it is false, UNLESS there is actual malice (you know it was false
        when you published it, or you acted in "reckless disregard" of its falsehood)
    - Public speech about public issues
    - Hustler v Falwell
      - Harm to a figure or even emotional harm to the figure is not enough to
        make speech unprotected


  Argument against running this
    - Malice is also "reckless disregard"
