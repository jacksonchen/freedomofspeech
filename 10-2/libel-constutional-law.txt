Is low value speech protected? (two-level theory: high value and low value)
  There are two results from segregating high value from low value speech:
  - Burden of justification imposed on government when regulating high-value
    speech would have to be lowered (government will remove speech that
    it does not like because it is "low value")
  - Properly stringent standards applied to efforts to regulate high-value speech
    would have to be applied to low value speech as well (speech that should
    be removed cannot be removed)

False statement of fact
  - Court maintained that there is no such thing as a false idea
  - The issue is "false statements of fact", which generally arise in the
    context of defamation
  - NYT v Sullivan
    - Question for the Court: Does 1A limit State from awarding damages in a
      libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct
    - Case: Sullivan claims to be libeled by a full page advertisement in NYT.
      There were several undisputed inaccuracies in the advertisement (but not
      absolute falsehoods).
        - The ad never mentioned Sullivan by name but the police, which he claims
          implies him
        - Sullivan "made no effort to prove that he suffered actual pecuniary loss
          as a result of the alleged libel"
        - Jury was instructed just to find if the statements were libelous, with
          falsity and malice presumed and general damages presumed
    - Court's opinion: Reverse the lower judgement and that Alabama courts did
      not follow constitutional protection of 1A
      - Libel is covered by the 1A, as debate on public issues will include
        "unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials". The
        ad covers national issues and is thus absolutely relevant to 1A.
      - Inaccuracies are protected since speaker should not have the burden of
        proving truth; i.e "breathing space" for freedoms of expression
        - Putting the burden on speaker leads to "self-censorship" and hurts
          public debate of issues
      - Criticism of "official conduct does not lose its constitutional protection
        merely because it is effective criticism and hence diminishes their
        official reputations"
      - Exception where officials can recover damages: "actual malice" -- with
        knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth
        - In this case, NYT only showed negligence in not double checking the truth,
          not "reckless disregard". Also the ad was not "of and concerning" the respondent,
          since it only criticized the government (the police) and not the official
    - Justice Black and Douglas concurring opinion:
      - The concept of malice is hard to prove or to disprove
      - "State libel laws threaten the very existence of an American press"
        - The punitive awards for libel threaten the financial sustainability
          of the newspaper
      - They believe the Constitution grants "the press an absolute immunity for
        criticism of the way public officials do their public duty"
    - Crux of the case: Censorial power would be "Government over the people" and
      not "in the people over the Government"
  - Curtis Publishing Co v Butts & Associated Press v Walker
    - Question to the Court: Whether libel action brought by an individual who
      is a "public figure" but not a "public official" must also be governed
      by NYT standard
    - Butts was an acclaimed head football coach, employed by the private Georgia
      Athletic Association. Walker had a distinguished military career but was
      a private person.
    - Court found NYT standard was applicable to public figures as well. Also,
      Butts and Walker both constituted public figures.
      - Public figures have "ready access to mass media and communication both
        to influence policy and to counter criticism of their views"
  - Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc
    - Gertz, a Chicago attorney representing a kid who was killed by Chicago police,
      claimed libel against a publisher for stating that Gertz has a criminal
      record and long-standing communist affiliations
    - Jury awarded $50k for Gertz, the trial court reversed & concluded that NYT
      standard applied to any discussion of "public issue"
    - Court reversed the trial court
      - "There is no constitutional value in false statements of fact", but it
        is "inevitable in free debate"
      - However, NYT only applies constitutional protection of defamation to public persons,
        as public people "voluntarily" exposed themselves to the increased risk
        of injury from defamatory falsehood
      - A public person this may be someone who is "drawn into a particular public
        controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues"
        (i.e a temporary public person)
      - Private people did not sign up to be exposed to defamation, and thus
        there is a "strong state interest in compensating private individuals for
        injury to reputation", BUT this only extends to compensation for ACTUAL injury
        (i.e not compensation for presumed injury)
  - Dun & Bradstreet v Greenmoss Builders
    - Case: Credit reporting agency told five subscribers that a construction contractor
      filed voluntary petition for bankruptcy, which is inaccuracy
    - Trial judge instructed jury it could award presumed and punitive damages without
      a showing of "actual malice"
    - Court's opinion: Affirmed the jury's verdict in 5 to 4 judgement
      - Speech on "matters of purely private concern is of less First Amendment concern",
        i.e state regulation of such speech does not threaten free and robust debate
        of public issues
      - In cases of speech involving no matters of public concern, "state interest
        adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages even absent
        a showing of actual malice"
  - US v Alvarez
    - Case: Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime for anyone to state they were awarded
      a medal authorized by Congress. Alvarez falsely stated that he received the
      Congressional Medal of Honor.
    - Supreme Court held the Act unconstitutional
      - Stolen Valor Act applies too broadly, without regard to whether anyone is
        harmed by the falsehood
      - Government can't compile "a list of subjects about which false statements
        are punishable"
      - Government failed to show why counterspeech would not suffice to achieve its interest
        (of protecting Congressional medals)
        - Court proposed creating a database that listed Congressional Medal of
          Honors winners
    - Breyer's concurrence:
      - Government can constitutional restrict some types of factually false statements
        (fraud, perjury, etc). But, the government provided no convincing explanation why
        a more "finely tailored statute would not work", thus Stolen Valor Act fails
        intermediate scrutiny
    - Alito's dissent:
      - Stolen Valor Act presents no risk at all that valuable speech will be suppressed,
        since it is a narrow law
      - The Act is also viewpoint neutral
  - Hustler Magazine v Falwell
    - Case: Hustler published a parody of an ad concerning well-known Jerry Falwell.
      It pictured him in a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.
      The ad had small print at the bottom, stating ad parody, not to be taken seriously.
    - Jury found in favor of Falwell on intentional infliction of emotional distress claim
    - Court reversed:
      - Respondent argues that different standard should apply here because the State
        seeks emotional distress rather than reputational damage
      - However, the Court holds that "the law does not regard the intent to inflict
        emotional distress as one which should receive much solicitude"
      - Court also rejected Falwall's argument that this cartoon was especially
        outrageous, as the Court does not believe that an outrageousness standard
        would be objective enough for jury evaluation
