Issue spotter
  - Get the rules of the issues you spot
  - Fact pattern
  - Weigh likely counterarguments to your argument
    - e.g this is an obscenity, but this doesn't seem to be based on sexual conduct

Advocacy of Illegal Conduct
  - Government CAN restrict speech that advocates or incites illegal conduct
  - Brandenburg: Imminent and likely to produce such action
  - Very protective standard (e.g much be imminent, must be about to occur)
  - Schenck v US: Holmes' dissent introduced clear and present danger test
  - Abrams case, Holme's dissent:
    (1) Competition of the market (marketplace of ideas)
    (2) Not punishing opinions just because we (the government) disagree
  - Whitney v California: Brandeis' concurrence says that public discussion is
    a duty, not a right

Hostile Audience & Fighting Words
  - Terminiello: Speech may not be restricted because the ideas offend the audience
    - Offensiveness ("stirs the public to anger") does not justify restriction of speech
    - Function of free speech under our system is to invite dispute; best serves its
      high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction
      with conditions as they are
  - Feiner v New York
    - Court found Fiener's arrest is okay because the police thought that a riot might
      occur
  - Chaplinsky: Fighting words doctrine
    - Well-defined narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention of which
      is perfectly acceptable (fighting words -- words very utterance inflict
      injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace)
    - Later decisions have narrowed this doctrine, and no other decision has
      upheld a restriction based on the fighting words doctrine (e.g Texas v Johnson)
    - Only really cite this case for fighting words

Obscenity
  - First Amendment does not protect this
  - Miller v California: Established guidelines
    (a) "Average person apply contemporary community standards" would find prurient interest
        (sexual desire, interest)
    (b) Patently offensive
    (c) The work lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific value

Lewd or Indecent Speech
  - Things that don't meet the Miller test, but are still obscene
  - Cohen v California
    - Not obscenity (not erotic), not fighting words or hostile audience (not directed to any person)
    - Gov't can only shut off discourse to protect others from hearing if its proves
      to be substantial privacy interests being invaded in an intolerable manner
      (e.g door to door solicitors may be an invasion of privacy interest)
    - Viewers could've easily looked away
    - Government cannot prohibit lewd and indecent speech
  - Pacifica case
    - Limited civil sanctions can constitutionally be invoked against broadcast of
      patently offensive words dealing with sex and execration. The words need
      not be obscene to warrant sanctions
    - Relevant factors: audience, medium, time of day, and method of transmission
    - "Emphatically narrow holding"
  - Sable Communications: "Dial-a-porn" services prohibitions were unconstitutional
    - Telephone communications different from broadcast
  - Reno v ACLU
    - Risk of encountering indecent material on Internet by accident is remote
      because of the number of affirmative steps required to access specific material

Hate Speech
  - Only laws that are narrowly tailored and applied in circumstances that constitute
    incitement to imminent lawless conduct or violence are okay
  - Any content based restriction will face strict scrutiny
    - Must have compelling government interest
    - Narrowly tailored to achieve this purpose
    - Law uses least restrictive means to achieve the purpose
  - RAV v St Paul
    - Cross burning ordinance was overly broad and impermissibly content-based,
      violated 1A
    - Prohibits permitted speech on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses
  - Wisconsin v Mitchell
    - State's hate crime penalty enhancement statute is okay, since physical assault
      is not expressive conduct protected by 1A

Libel
  - When should someone pay money damages to someone else for making false statements about them?
  - NYT v Sullivan
    - Alabama strict liability standard is unconstitutional
    - Very high standard for public officials (and later expanded to public figures)
      - Can only recover damages if the statement is made with actual malice
        (known to be false or reckless disregard about the falseness)
      - Reckless disregard: Aware of the risk or consequences of being false but
        published anyways
    - Debate on public issues should be open, and this may include 'unpleasantly sharp
      attacks' on public figures
    - Breathing space principle: Don't want to deter criticism of the government in
      fear of punishment
  - Curtis Publishing v Butts
    - Expanded the NYT v Sullivan standard to public figures, as well as public officials
    - Public figures have as ready access as public officials to mass media of communication,
      both to influence policy and to counter criticism of their views and activities
    - Self correcting theory: If public figures have the ability to self correct (the record),
      it shouldn't be up to the courts to "correct the record"
  - Gertz v Welch Inc
    - Private individuals should be more protected, and thus don't need to prove actual malice
    - But even for private individuals, states may not impose strict liability on news media
    - Standard of fault (less than actual malice) limits compensation for private people
      to actual injury (can't include like emotional damage)
      - If you want punitive damages against publisher, MUST show actual malice
  - What is a public figure?
    - Full purpose: An individual who has pervasive fame or notoriety that they
      are public figure for all purposes
    - Voluntary public figure: Someone who injects themselves into particular public
      controversy and therefore becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues
  - Other false statement cases
    - Liability for inaccurate credit report? Court upheld defamation award (Greenmoss Builders)
      - Speech on matters of purely private concern is of less 1A concern
    - Criminal to lie?
      - Stolen Valor Act was ruled unconstitutional in Alvarez case, since content-based
        restrictions on speech are subject to strict scrutiny, and are almost
        always invalid
      - Stolen Valor Act was drafted too broadly ("no clear limiting principle")
        attempting to limit speech that could cause no harm
      - Criminal punishment for such speech is improper
  - Hustler Magazine v Falwell
    - Parody of Falwell: Falwell sued for libel AND intentional infliction of emotional distress
      (to sue for libel, need to prove false statement of fact & actual malice)
    - Jury found against Falwell on libel claim, a parody cannot be understood as
      stating actual facts
    - Jury found in favor of Falwell on the intentional infliction of emotional distress
    - The Court reversed: Public figures cannot recover for intentional infliction
      of emotional distress without showing the publication contained a false statement
      of fact which was made with "actual malice" (pretty much the same standard as libel)
    - Parody could only lose a libel suit if a "reasonable" person might find it as
      a false statement of fact

Privacy
  - Court takes strong position against gov't efforts to prohibit publication of
    truthful information (see Pentagon Papers)
  - Some types of info so private and non-newsworthy that it can be restricted the
    publication on theory that they have "low" 1A value
  - Cox Broadcasting v Cohn
    - A reporter legally obtained the name of a rape/murder victim by looking through
      public judicial records associated with the case, then he reported her name on news
    - Court found that State cannot punish the reporter
    - While there is a zone of privacy surrounding every individual, but info that
      is publicly accessible cannot be punished for broadcasting
    - The responsibility is on the State to avoid exposing private information publicly
  - Takeaways
    - Truthful disclosure of private facts concerning an individual constitutes a tort
      if disclosure is "highly offensive" to a reasonable person and is not in itself newsworthy
  - Unlawfully obtained information
    - Bartnicki v Vopper: Radio station got access to unlawfully obtained tape recording
    - Court found that radio station cannot be punished because the topic was a matter
      of public concern, and the broadcaster did not unlawfully obtain it themselves,
      even though the broadcaster knew it was obtained illegally

Symbolic Speech
  - Non-verbal conduct (e.g burning a draft card or a flag), when is a law regulating such conduct unconstitutional?
  - US v O'Brien
    - A guy burned his draft card as symbolic speech. Statute that he was convicted for:
      "anyone who forges, alters, knowingly destroys, ... any such certificate"
    - Court ruled that the statute was constitutional, as gov't regulation is sufficiently
      justified (compelling government interest to maintain the draft)
    - Government regulation is unrelated to expression, since it is about maintaining the draft
    - Regulation is unrelated to content and is narrowly tailored to achieve the government interest
    - Harlan concurrence: It would be unconstitutional to prevent a speaker from reaching a
      significant audience with whom he could not otherwise lawfully communicate, but
      that does not apply in O'Brien's case
  - Tinker v Des Moines School District
    - School officials suspended 3 students because they wore black armbands to protest Vietnam
    - Court invalidated the suspensions -> wearing an armband for expressing certain
      views is symbolic act and is free expression
    - School authorities did not purport wearing all symbols of political or
      controversial significant, but it was banning a particular symbol (specific viewpoint discrimination)
  - NAACP v Alabama
    - Relatively rare decision where Court invalidates an incidental restriction on expression
    - All out-of-state corporations doing business in the state must disclose all their
      members.
    - Court struck out the Alabama provision since it would have adverse ability for
      NAACP members' constitutional rights to assembly and speak
  - Holder v Humanitarian Law Project
    - Federal statute made it unlawful for anyone to provide "material support" to
      foreign terrorist organizations (this includes expert advice)
    - Humanitarian Law Project wanted to help terrorist' legal channels
    - Although the Court upheld the statute on other grounds, it rejected the gov't's argument:
      - O'Brien does not provide applicable standard since this statute regulates speech
        on the basis of its content
      - It's more like Cohen because it's content based, so strict scrutiny was applied
        and passed (hence the statute was constitutional)
  - Flag misuse: Spence v Washington
    - Washington statute on flag misuse, cannot exhibit an American flag with anything
      else superimposed on it
    - Court declared the statute unconstitutional, since it is an expression prohibition
      (in O'Brien it must not be related to expression for it to be okay)
  - Flag burning: Texas v Johnson
  - Barnes v Glen Theatre: Court held that state prohibition against public nudity does not violate 1A
  - Eric v Pap's AM: Upheld ordinance banning nude dancing, since it satisfied O'Brien test
  - Content neutral restrictions v content-based
    - Content-neutral: Limit expression without regard to its content. Turn neither on their face nor as applied
      - Prohibition on the use of loudspeakers, ban on billboards, campaign contributions, draft cards
      - Must only survive intermediate scrutiny
      - Generally tested by "balancing"
    - Content based: Presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny, the highest
      form of judicial review
      - Ones that were upheld: Holder case (only time when restriction on political
        speech passed the Brandenburg test)
  - Speech on private property
    - Court has protected the right of owners or private property to prevent others from
      using their property for speech purposes
    - Struthers case: Struck down conviction of door-to-door religious solicitor,
      but left the decision to property owner
    - Only exception was a company town case where it practically acted as public grounds
      (Marsh/March v Alabama)
      - Applied to shopping malls

Public forum
  - Hague v CIO: Gives us public forum doctrine
    - Streets and parks are public forum because they have "immemorially" been used
      for assembly and public meetings
  - Schneider v State
    - Could not ban leafletting on the public streets
  - Jamison v Texas
    - Invalidating city ordinance prohibiting dissemination of leaflets
  - Hague/Schneider theory applied to public property that has been used "time out of mind" for speech purposes
  - US v Grace
    - Court invalidated federal statute prohibiting people to display on sidewalks outside of
      Supreme Court any flag banner or device meaned to ....
    - Court said public sidewalks around Supreme Court are public forums, and the gov't cannot restrict
    - Government may enforce a reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions in public
      forums only if
      (1) restrictions are content-neutral
      (2) narrowly tailored to serve gov't interest
      (3) leave open ample alternative channels of communication
    - Gov't may only absolutely prohibit some speech if it serves a "compelling government interest"
  - Grayned v Rockford
    - Demonstration was violating local ordinance preventing noise or diversion around a school
    - Court upheld the conviction, and said that disrupting school activities is compelling and narrowly tailored
    - Noted that the decision is made on an individualized basis
  - Frisby v Schultz
    - Court upheld ordinance banning targeted residential picketing, since it said
      it gave ample alternate means of protest
    - Narrowly tailored to serve compelling gov't interest: the privacy of the home
      (is of the highest order in a free and civilized society)
  - Abortion clinic buffer zones: Content based v content neutral (depends on the
    nature of establishment that is being regulated)
    - Court is guessing which ideas are being expressed if you protest outside
      an abortion clinic -> more content based and thus subject to more scrutiny
  - Licensing (permits)
    - Cox v New Hampshire: Court upheld convictions on Jehovah's Witnesses that
      did not get permits.
      - The guy who gives out permits can only consider time, place, and manner
      - The licensing board was not vested with arbitrary power
  - Fees
    - Can only charge nominal amounts that cover the cost of policing or cleaning up (public expense of an event)
    - Cannot charge huge fees that serve as a restriction on those who can't afford
    - Factors depend on the size of the crowd or parade
  - Disclosure
    - Required disclosure would restrict freedom to distribute info and thus
      freedom of expression
    - For speakers persecuted, anonymous pamphleteering or whatever is maybe
      their only way for advocacy and dissent (anonymity is a shield from the tyranny
      of the majority)
  - Krishna Consciousness v Lee: Airports aren't public forums
  .... (the slides are being sent)

Prior Restraints
  - Court held special presumption under 1A against use of prior restraints
  - A prior restraint may be invalid even if the expression at issue could be constitutional prohibited
  - Putting things through a censor (Lovell v Griffin) is struck down
  - Censorship system for motion pictures is only okay, when the burden is on the censors (see Freedman v Maryland)
  - Near v Minnesota: Enjoining scandalous newspapers is facially unconstitutional
  - Pentagon Papers case: Can only block publication if it will cause direct, immediate,
    and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people

Freedom of the Press
  - Major cases
    - Branzburg (no right as a journalist to keep information confidential if you
      are required to testify)
    - Richmond Newspapers (1A right to attend criminal trials -> 1A includes right to receive information and ideas)
    - Minneapolis Star v MN (can't treat newspapers differently and single them out via a law)
    - Miami Herald: The government cannot interfere with the editor's role in a newspaper,
      and can't impose penalty on the basis of content
    - Red Lion: Broadcasting is different from newspapers (FCC Fairness Doctrine)
      - Scarcity doctrine: Gov'ts role in allocating scarcity

Campaign Finance
  - Buckley v Valeo
    - Upheld contribution limits but stuck down expenditure limits
    - Started the idea that the Court disagreed that spending money is conduct
    - Laws that limit political speech are subject to strict scrutiny
  - Citizens Unite
    - Speaker does not lose their protection because their identity is a corporation
    - Corporations are some of the most important players in the economy
    - Here is an example where the Court did NOT follow stare decisis
