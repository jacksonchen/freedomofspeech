====Hate Speech and Pornography=====

Beauharnais v Illinois
  - Facts
    - Beauharnais, white nationalist leader, organized racist leaftlet distirbution
    - Convicted under Illinois statute saying unlawful to distribute publications
      against certain groups that creates "breaches of peace or riots"
    - Judge overseeing conviction refused to consider Beauharnais' offer of proof
      on the issue of truth, and didn't tell jury to consider clear and present danger
  - Court ruled in favor of conviction 5-4. Majority opinion:
    - "Libelous utterances are no essential part of any
      exposition of ideas". Drew upon Chaplinsky saying that harm of these ideas
      outweighs any benefits it brings to "finding the truth"
    - Court was considering if Constitution prevents States from punishing libels,
      and decided that can since libel crimes against individuals can also be
      applied against groups
    - Illinois has history of racial tensions and riots
  - Justice Black's dissent:
    - Group libel law is effectively censorship
  - Consequences
    - Group libel is outside of constitutionally protected speech (because of its
      "low value"), hence not subject to clear and present danger standard
    - This case did not define libel as false statements of fact, but other cases
      (NYT and Hustler) narrowed libel to be false statements of fact
    - Why is group libel of low value?
      - Logical extension of the fighting words doctrine from Chaplinsky
      - Cannot seriously be maintained that 1A meant to protect speech that
        "portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity, or lack of virtue of
        a class of citizens"

Hate speech
  - How can one argue for censorship of hate speech without supporting McCarthyism?
    - Racial hate speech is a doctrine that is uniformly/universally rejected
  - Hate speech doesn't work in the marketplace of ideas, because the marketplace
    assumes an equal starting line for everyone
  - US pure speech jurisprudence of accepting hate speech is anomalous internationally
  - Counterpoint: Every proponent of speech regulation through the generations have
    argued against what ended up being fundamental constitutional values (think draft
    dodgers)
    - "Everyone struggle for freedom of expression has been a great struggle
      against racist tyranny in the US"

RAV v City of St Paul
  - Petitioner burned cross on black family's lawn, violating city ordinance
    against racially motivated actions that "arouse anger, alarm or resentment"
  - State Supreme Court upheld conviction since "arouse anger, ..." falls under
    fighting words in Chaplinsky, hence narrowing the scope of the ordinance
  - The Court's opinion (written by Scalia)
    - Reversed the conviction: unconstitutional because it "prohibits speech
      solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses"
    - Libel can only be proscribed that is critical of the government
    - Also the class of speech can only be content-neutral (e.g can prohibit
      obscenity that is patently offensive in its prurience, but can't only
      ban sexual speech that includes offensive political messages)
    - The ordinance applies the fighting words doctrine to specific political issues,
      which is not a content neutral ban of the fighting words
    - St Paul argued that this viewpoint discrimination served a compelling
      state interest. The Court thinks the interest is compelling, but because of
      the alternatives available (doing a broad fighting words ban), this specific
      route was not necessary
  - Dissent (Judge White, Blackmun, OConnor):
    - Speech with no value is justification to ban categories of speech, but not
      justification to ban certain viewpoints. Contradictory.
    - The ordinance is unconstitutional because just provoking offense is not
      enough to ban speech (e.g Cohen v California), thus is way too broad
  - Judge Steven's dissent:
    - Reads the ordinance not as a ban on certain content but a ban on injuries
      caused to specific categories of people, which is constitutional

Wisconsin v Mitchell
  - Mitchell, who is black, urged a group of blacks to assault a white boy,
    so he was convicted of assault. But his sentence was lengthened because the
    attack was seen as racially motivated.
  - Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled racial motivation as unconstitutional because
    it treats people differently based on their beliefs
  - Court overturned Wisconsin ruling since this conduct is not expression,
    and this specific conducts "inflicts greater individual and societal harm"
  - What difference does this have with RAV? -> cross burning is speech but
    beating an individual because of his race isn't speech?

Virginia v Black
  - Consider whether Virginia's statute banning cross burning with "an intent to
    intimidate a person or group of persons" violates 1A
  - A KKK rally occurred where speakers threatened violence against black people,
    and then burned a huge cross on private property (with the owner's permission)
    - The head of the rally found guilty by jury, who were instructed that the
      "the burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which you
      may infer the required intent"
  - Supreme Court of Virginia struck down the cross burning, saying it was indistinguishable
    from RAV v St Paul
  - Conclusion of the Court:
    - State may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate
    - "Regardless of whether the message is a political one or whether the message
      is meant to intimidate, the burning of a cross is a symbol of hate"
    - Sometimes cross burnings only mean to intimidate and carry no message
    - State may punish a "true threat", and the speaker need not actually intend
      to carry out the threat, thus intimidation is a type of "true threat"
    - "The fact that cross burning is symbolic expression does not resolve the
      constitutional question" -> RAV content-based discrimination was bc city
      was allowed to impose special prohibitions on speakers who express views
      on disfavored subjects.
    - RAV case did not prohibit all forms of content-based discrimination, but just
      that some types of content discrimination did not violate 1A
    - Virginia may ban specific intimidation through cross burning because of
      the burnings "long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence"
    - Also held the prima facie evidence provision unconstitutional, since jury
      just needs to show intent to burn, rather than intent to intimidate
      (burning cross at a rally is protected)
  - Souter, Kennedy, Ginsburg dissent in part:
    - Banning cross burning will also ban the legitimate viewpoints that KKK
      members have, that are not intimidatory

Pornography
  - Just banning porn that depicts subordination essentially only allowing approved
    viewpoints, thus you cannot argue that the porn is low value
  - Low value? -- Purpose of the speaker is relevant
  - Chaplinsky: Fighting words are "low value" and thus do not contribute to the
    marketplace of ideas (but Roberts Court has chiveled away at this)
