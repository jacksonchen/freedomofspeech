How does the Supreme Court deal with a speaker that advocates for people to commit a crime?
  - Started answering this question in 1919 with a couple cases (Debs, Schenck, and Frohwerk)
    - Literally no cases reached the Supreme Court on 1A before 1919
    - Cases started popping up because of the draft since Congress passed the Espionage
      Act of 1917
    - Bolshevik Revolution happens in 1917 as well, makes people scared of Communist Revolution
    - Lots of new social movements (women's rights, rise of anarchism), causes lots of
      panic and insecurity => causes the state to arrest speakers
    - The original test was the "bad tendency" test
      - Not very protective, easy to stretch any speech to cause a tendency for bad behavior
    - Then Learned Hand's "Express incitement" test
    - In these entry cases, the Court raised a first test:
      - Holmes' dissent clear and present danger test
        - Danger is serious, and is very immediate
        - However, this is actually fairly weak test (see Schenck, Frohwerk, Debs)
      - However adoption of Holmes' test didn't happen immediately
  - In the 30-40's, more cases start to take the stronger Holmes' version of the test
  - In the 50's, Dennis case happens. Supreme Court weighs the gravity of evil (overthrowing the whole gov't)
    discounted by probability
  - Brandenberg in 1960's
    - Consolidation into very strong free speech protection
    - Is the speech directed at producing "likely, imminent lawless action"?
    - People think it's a mix of Learned Hand and clear and present danger
    - Yet Dennis isn't overruled, so future cases solidify and further strengthen 1A

Case: President wants to a new "No more fowl language" campaign and to expel students
  that say a certain 4 letter word
  Prezbo says that four letter word isn't necessary -- just look at any publication made within Columbia

Argument that this is unconstitutional
  - Cohen vs California
    - Foul language is okay because it expresses emotions (expressive speech)
  - Supreme Court cannot restrict ideas in the marketplace, and thus cannot restrict words

FCC vs Pacifica
  - (note this is AFTER Cohen) Supreme Court said that FCC can fine a broadcaster/radio station
    for airing indecent language (in this case a monologue that mocked public attitudes
    towards dirty words)
  - Court ruled it is okay to restrict words to a specific time of day
  - Consequences of this ruling: Unlike public speech, for radio and TV, a
    government org is allowed to sanction certain words. Why is this?
    - TV and radio are generally in a private space (generally in the home)
    - The reason why private space isn't allowed but public space is allowed is that
      there is a difference of expectation (expected to run into this stuff in public
      but not in your own home)
    - Why should speech be restricted if user can just turn off radio/TV?
      - Broadcast is an exception because of its "unique" presence in the home
    - Presence of children around the house is a special factor in TV and radio
      - Why isn't this a regard in Cohen? (i.e in public spaces)
      - Value for society to allow open debate in public outweighs the interest
        of parents and children

Why is hate speech protected in the US?
  - Fact: Hate speech is protected in the US (bigoted speech against religion,
    ethnicity, gender, color, etc)

  - Better that hate speech is out in the open because it can be dealt with
  - This is a viewpoint and you can't shut down viewpoints
    - Bad argument since this speech is meant to be restricted because of the viewpoint
  - By drawing lines, the government can stretch the lines to shut down speech it does not like
    - Virginia v Black: Court held it was permissible to ban cross-burning
      if it can be shown that it was intended to intimidate
      - The Court brings out the concept of a genuine threat (another exception to 1A)
  - Illinois vs Beauharnais
    - Court ruled for a hate speech ban
      - Can't stop the State from wanting decent order
    - This cases was decided in the 50's before 1A became much more protective
    - Scholars say this is no longer Court law
  - However, hate crimes don't hold this protection and can be prosecuted more harshly

Next class will be libel
