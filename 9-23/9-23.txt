Case: Climate change activist in front of large crowd.
  "We must take the law in our own hands" -- if need be,
  some buildings must be blown up in the next week.

  In public park in Manhattan

  Tenor of the crowd
    - Enthusiastic, "we agree"
    - Rowdy and pushy, explicitives were thrown

Argument that this is protected
  - What 1A problem is this: speech advocating illegal action
  - Brandenberg case
    - Did Brandenberg mean to show incitement is an explicit part of the test? Not sure
    - "Except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing
      imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action" (1385)
    - Brandenberg Test: Likely to incite imminent lawless action
      - This test was first framed through "clear and present danger"

If the Central Park case was modified where the speaker started delegating roles
  to blow things up to members of the audience...

Argument that speech would still be protected
  - This speech is still not imminent, thus fails the Brandenberg test
    - This is because there is time for there to be counterspeech to dissuade the
      audience. This is a public setting where this can be done
  - Police would have good reason to watch members of the audience assigned,
    and even to help intervene

----------------
New Case: Meet a group of friends in my apartment. I say "it's time we commit
  some acts of violence". All my friends were persuaded. I say "over the next
  month, we will provide a cell of violence on behalf of climate change". My directions:
  - John will blow up this building
  - Sally will set fire to x

Note that I didn't call for anything to be done imminently

However, this speech would not be protected
  - This fails the imminent test (compared to the Central Park case above),
    because there is no room for counterspeech -- done in a private setting.
    - Speech that is part of the criminal process (e.g counseling for murder)
      is NOT protected
  - What's done here in the private speech is *too dangerous* and also lacks of value
    to public debate (public realm of search for truth)
    - The more public the speech, the stronger the protection it has
    - This is also why shouting "Fire" in theater doesn't contribute to the public
      search for truth

----------------
New case: Standing up on Low, "you should have this spray can and write something
  obscene to the administration on the steps". People are really excited about
  this idea and all take out their spray cans. Police arrest the speaker.

Argument that the speech is protected
  - The case is diff from above since here we concede that the illegal action
    here was imminent
  - Brandeis and Whitney cases: 1A is extremely protective about speech under
    the rationale of searching for truth, until the point where it's just about
    to lead to *grave* illegal action
  - This situation isn't grave at all, hence we should err towards protecting the speech

New Case: White Nationalists vs the protestors. Lots of yelling.
  Police officer comes up to me and tells me to stop. I say "fuck you"

Argument that the speech would be protected
  - Cohen v California
  - Even though the crowd was rowdy and was volatile, the State (i.e the police)
    have to deal with that. Thus, the speaker should be allowed
    - Otherwise the heckler's veto doctrine (if the State used negative response
      of audience to speaker's idea as a basis of saying if the speech can continue
      or be protected) -- 1A meant to protect speaker from State and audience
  - In fact, speaker should be protected -- people who are threatening violence
    against the speaker are the ones to be arrested

Consequences of the cases
  - Government will err towards peace and nonvolatility. 1A is a restraint against
    the government from doing this
  - Cohen v California started to put limits to Chaplinsky v New Hampshire
  - Court keeps saying it depends on the circumstances for shutting down speech
    for threatening violence, different cases have different ruling

Moving away from cases deciding if speaker should be protected for inciting illegal
  acts to cases where it's the audience reaction determining if speaker should be stopped
