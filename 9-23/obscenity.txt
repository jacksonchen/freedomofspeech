====== Obscenity ======

Tests of obscenity
  - Almost all activity around obscenity happened post Civil War
  - Original test was Hicklin test (Regina v Hicklin): "Whether the tendency
    of the matter is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to
    such immoral influences" (1525).
  - 1930's: Hicklin test was rejected, and instead a standard focused on
    the effect on the average person. "It was generally assumed that 1A posed
    no barrier to the suppression of obscenity"
    - Chaplinsky features obscene as an unprotected utterance from 1A
  - First time the Court addressed the obscenity question directly was Roth v US
  - Two periods of obscenity in the Court
    - First was in the Warren Court which started in Roth until 1973, this was
      largely unsuccessful
      - Each justices' definition of obscenity was very different
    - Second was starting with 1973 Miller v California and Paris Adult Theater v Slaton,
      both cases have reformulated the Court's doctrine on obscenity

Roth v US (and Alberts v California)
  - Roth was convicted of violating a federal statute prohibiting any person to mail
    any "obscene" publication. While Alberts was convicted of violating a California
    statute prohibiting any person to distribute any "obscene" writing
    - He was effectively distributing pornographic magazines
  - The Court affirmed both convictions. Justice Brennan delivered majority opinion
    - The question as hand was whether "obscenity is utterance within the area
      of protected speech and press"
    - "Implicit in the history of 1A is the rejection of obscenity as utterly
      without redeeming social importance"
      - 13 of 14 states that ratified Constitution had prosecution for libel,
        blasphemy, and profanity. "In light of this history it is apparent
        obscenity, like, was outside the protection intended for speech and press"
    - Caveat: "Sex and obscenity are not synonymous." Just portrayal of sex is okay,
      but "obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing
      to prurient interest"
    - Lays out a test: "Whether to the average person, applying contemporary
      community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole
      appeals to the prurient interest"
  - Dissent (by Douglas and Black): "I do not think that the problem can be resolved
    by the Court's statement that obscenity is not expression protected by 1A"
    - They have the same confidence in the ability of people to reject "noxious literature"
      in the same capacity to sort out true from false in political speech

Arguments why obscenity should not be banned
  - Winters v New York: "The line between the informing and the entertaining is too
    elusive for the protection for the basic right. Everyone is familiar with instances
    of propaganda through fiction. What is one man's amusement, teaches another's doctrine"
  - Court's use of history was "so casual as to be alarming". Blasphemy, and the
    Sedition Act of 1798 were not used in cases when carving 1A protections for those
  - Obscenity was also not unlawful under either English or American law in 1792,
    it was only illegal amongst the states
  - Concept of obscenity is fundamentally a "viewpoint-based restriction" because it
    is justified by moral objections to the ideas or messages that sexual speech is
    said to convey -> democratic society must be free to perfect its own standards of
    conduct and belief through the heat of unrepressed controversy and debate

Arguments why states may ban obscenity
  - State may suppress obscenity because it erodes moral standards not by rational
    persuasion but by indirect degradation of values
    - Physical stimulation rather than intellectual challenge
    - Desensitive men by relying on bombarding their feelings
  - State may suppress the dissemination of obscenity to minors because they are
    especially vulnerable to its harmful effects

Stanley v Georgia
  - People have the constitutional right to obtain obscene materials
  - "Mere categorization of these films as obscene is insufficient justification for
    such drastic invasion of personal liberties"
    - However, this only applies to private spaces; in US v Reidel the Court held that
      businesses did not have the right to distribution such matter

Miller v California
  - Miller conducted a mass mailing campaign to advertise the sale of illustrated
    books, euphemistically called adult material.
    - Convicted based on causing five unsolicited advertising brochures to be sent
      through the mail
  - Burger wrote the majority opinion
    - Confined the permissible scope of state obscenity regulation regarding sexual conduct:
      (a) Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would
          find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest
      (b) Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual
          conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law
      (c) Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,
          political, or scientific value
    - Sex and nudity on film exhibited in public should be treated like live sex and
      and nudity exhibited in public
      - "Patently offensive depictions or descriptions must have serious literary, ... value
	 to merit 1A protection"
    - Also held that issues of what is "prurient interest" and "patently offensive" is too
      vague for such a vast nation, and thus out of the Court's purview and up to the states
    - Uphold the Roth case holding that "obscene material is not protected by 1A"
  - Douglas' dissent: Claims that regulating obscenity is permitting "punishment for ideas
    that are offensive to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment"

Paris Adult Theatre I v Slaton
  - Petitioners are two adult movie theaters with reasonable protection at the front
    against minors. They showed two very explicit adult films in the theater.
  - Respondent demanded the two films be declared obscene and the theaters be enjoined
    from exhibiting the films
  - Georgia Supreme Court held that exhibition of the films should be enjoined
  - Court's opinion, written by Burger:
    - "We categorically disapprove the theory obscene, pornographic films acquire
       constitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited
       for consenting adults only"
    - Thus, even shielding and putting up notices at the front of the theater is not enough:
      Conduct involving consenting adults is not constitutionally protected from state regulation
    - There is a legitimate state interests in stemming "the tide of commercialized obscenity",
      including rights other than those of the advocates involved (public quality of life,
      community environment) -> "what is commonly read and seen and heard and done intrudes
      upon us all, want it or not"
      - Mentions that even if there is not data to prove correlation btw obscenity and bad
	behavior, state legislatures could "quite reasonably determine that such a connection
	does or might exist"
    - Points out that obscene material and crime are correlated
  - Dissent, led by Justice Brennan: The test allows suppression if government proves it
    lacks "serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value", but the Roth test
    holds that material is obscene if it lacks redeeming social value, and thus allows
    for "widespread suppression of sexually oriented speech"
    - Also the fact that the state felt the need to intervene even though it was directed
      at consenting adults means that the state has an ulterior motive
    - "We rejected as wholly inconsistent with the philosophy of 1A the notion that there is
       a legitimate state concern in the control of the moral content of a person's thoughts"
    - The definition of obscenity is too unfocused and ill defined

How does obscenity apply to the Internet given the community standards requirement
  - Ashcroft v ACLU -- Child Online Protection Act regulating obscene material on the Internet
    was not invalid because of local community standards -- an individual has no control
    over the geographic spread of the content they send
  - The obscenity doctrine has effectively been left in the dust with the advent of the Internet
    and widespread distribution -- overwhelming local law enforcement

Child Pornography
  - New York v Ferber
    - A Manhattan bookstore was prosecuted for selling two films to an undercover cop. The
      film was about young boys masturbating.
    - Jury held films were not obscene but convicted Ferber for violating NY statute prohibiting
      the distribution of any material depicting a "sexual performance" by a child under 16
    - Court unanimously upheld the decision, White delivered opinion:
      - State's interest in safeguarding well-being of minors is "compelling"
      - Distribution of child porn is "intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children"
	- Circulation harms the permanent record of the child's participation
      - Commercialization of child porn provides economic motive, but violate child labor laws
	- This economic motive also allows the State to shut down its distribution
      - No literary, scientific, or educational value in child porn
      - Also ruled that the New York statute was not constitutionally overbroad (so it's ok)
    - Alternative argument that the statute should be seen as a content-neutral restriction
      on an illegal "means" of expression, hence it is within the bounds of the Constitution
  - Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition
    - Court invalidated Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, which prohibited porn
      of people that appeared to be minors (adults that looked young, or animations)
    - Argument for the law
      - Compels pedophiles to act, or whets their appetite to commit real acts of violence to children
      - As imaging tech improves, it becomes impossible to discern real and fake child porn
    - Court's opinion
      - "Prospect of crime by itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech
      - Ferber case applies only to the production of the work, not its content
	- Ferber did not hold that all child porn had no value, but that some pictures may have
	  significant value as long as relied on virtual images, which this law attempts to outlaw
      - This case prohibits speech that is available to law-abiding adults as well
      - Virtual child porn whets the appetites of pedophiles is a bad argument, since it is
	equivalent to a heckler's veto: "Mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is
	not a sufficient reason for banning it"
      - Virtual child porn may be indistinguishable from real child porn: "The gov't may not
	suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech"
    - Justice O'Connor dissented in part: CPPA was constitutional insofar as it restricts
      virtual-child pornography

US v Stevens
  - US Code establishes a criminal penalty for anyone who knowingly distributes depictions of
    animal cruelty for "commercial gain" in interstate commerce
    - Exemption in the law for anything with religious, politicla, scientific, etc value
  - Stevens runs a dogfighting website that depicts fights that occur legally (in Japan),
    and was convicted of violating the code. Appeals court declared it unconstitutional and
    reversed his opinion
  - Court's opinion (by Justice Roberts)
    - Affirmed the lower court's decision
    - US asked Court to judge categories of speech for 1A based on value of speech vs societalc costs.
      Roberts rejects this: "1A guarantee of free speech does not extend only to categories of speech
      that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits"
    - Said that the literary etc value set in Miller only applies to sex, and not to all other
      types of speech
    - Also states that animal cruelty is not as much of a concern as the wellbeing of minors,
      thus banning child pornography had an compelling interest for the state
  - Alito's dissent:
    - The government also has a compelling interest to prevent torture of animals, specifically
      crush videos, meaning that all the arguments of Ferber apply here: (1) Underlying crimes could 
      not be combated without targeting the distribution, (2) also value of the content is
      questionable

Brown v Entertainment Merchants Association
  - California Bill prohibits sale or rental of violent video games to minors, where the
    content is "patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable
    to minors"
  - Court's opinion
    - Law is unconstitutional, as video games qualify for 1A protection
    - "It is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try"
    - There are exemptions -- obscenity [Roth], incitement [Brandenburg], fighting words [Chaplinsky]
      but these are "well defined and narrowly limited"
    - State does not possess "free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children
      may be exposed" -> bring up books (Hansel and Gretel) with gruesome deaths to demonstrate
    - Video games being interactive is no different from literature being interactive. Disgust
      is "not a valid basis for restricting expression"
    - Act is underinclusive, which gives it enough grounds on its own to discard it:
      - Treats video games differently from all other mediums (pictures of guns, etc)
      - Also allows this material to be left with children as long as one parent thinks it's OK,
	since it requires parental purchase, but there is no need for this
  - Thomas' dissent: Thinks that 1A does not include minors, and thus requiring parental approval
    is okay
  - Breyer's dissent: Does not think it is impermissibly vague, also doesn't think this restriction
    meaningfully injures speech: "all it prevents is a child from buying, without a parent's
    permission, a gruesomely violent video game"
    - Discusses scientified studies on violent video games
    - "What sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13yo a magazine with an image of a nude
      woman, while protecting a sale to that 13yo an interactive video game where he actively,
      but virtually, binds and gags the woma, then tortues and kills her?"
