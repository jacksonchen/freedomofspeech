----Section on lewd, profane, and indecent speech-----

Cohen v California
  - Cohen wore a jacket bearing "Fuck the Draft" in a public courthouse. Women and children
    were present. He did not engage or threaten anyone
  - Cohen was convicted for "maliciously and willfully disturbing the peace or quiet of any
    neighborhood or person by offensive conduct"
  - Court's opinion
    - Reversed the conviction
    - The question of the conviction was based on the offensiveness of words he used
      - Not an obscenity case, since it "must be in some significant way erotic"
    - On the question on if he violated the fighting words doctrine from Chaplinsky,
      "no individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded the words
      on appellant's jacket as a direct personal insult".
      - Also no chance of a group hostile reaction here
    - People could "avoid further bombardment...by simply averting their eyes"
      - Wasn't a case of him blasting this down a residential street, i.e no substantial
	privacy interests were being invaded
    - 1st and 14th amendment disable States from punishing public utterance of "fuck"
      in order to maintain what they regard as a suitable level of discourse
      - Hearing verbal tumults and offensive utterances are "necessary side effects of the
	broader enduring values which the process of open debate permits us to achieve"
      - "Government officials cannot make principles distinctions in this area that the
	Constitution leaves matters of taste and style so largely to the individual"
    - "Fuck the draft" also contains inexpressible emotions, which is embodied in 1A
    - Particular words also can't be banned without running a slippery slope of suppressing ideas

Why should profanity be protected?
  - Profanity has high 1A value because it is expressive, while obscenity does not have that
  - Profanity is distinct from fighting words -> must be unambiguous invitation to a brawl
  - Nothing in the Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communication,
    whatever its merit
    - Shutting off distribution because of offense is not meritable, since speech (or mail)
      could be avoided with low effort

Erznoznik v Jacksonville
  - Jacksonville ordinance that declared a public nuisance for any drive in movie theater to
    exhibit any motion picture with nude body parts visible from any public street or place
    - City's argument is protecting citizens against unwilling exposure
  - Court's opinion
    - Ordinance is invalidated since burden falls on the viewer to "avoid further bombardment
      of his sensibilities by averting his eyes" (from Cohen)
    - City's attempt to protect children is unwarranted since it is not directed at sexually
      explicit graphics, but any visibility of nude body parts in any context (even if it's
      inoffensive)
  - Burger dissented
    - Averting eyes is unreasonable in this situation with a huge public screen
    - This screen is more likely to divert attention and cause accidents

FCC v Pacifica Foundation
  - NY radio station broadcast "Filthy words" in the afternoon, which had every profanity availble
  - FCC, after a complaint, found it as a nuisance, and announced broadcasters may not air
    language that dscribes sexual, excretory activities in terms that are patently offensive
    as measured by contemporary community standards during daylight time.
  - Court's opinion
    - Upheld the FCC, since FCC objected only in the way in which Carlin express those ideas,
      and was not objecting to the idea itself
    - The ease at which children of all ages were able to access broadcast justify "special
      treatment of indecent broadcasting"
    - Exposing the monologue to hours when fewest unsupervised children would be exposed is okay
    - "Commission's holding does not prevent willing adults from purchasing Carlin's record,
      from attending his performances, or, indeed, from reading the transcript reprinted
      as an appendix to the Court's opinion
  - Dissent by Justice Brennan and Marshall
    - "The radio can be turned off"
    - Weight not granted to people who want to listen to such offensive broadcasts
    - "Court's result violates the principle of Butler v Michigan that the government may not
      reduce the adult population to reading only what is fit for children"

Profanity on radio
  - Banning fleeting explitives was not allowed (FCC v Fox Television Stations) because it
    violates due process

Sable Communications Inc v FCC
  - Federal statute prohibited interstate transmission of "indecent" commercial telephone
    messages (dial a porn services)
  - Court's opinion
    - Differentiated telephone communication from broadcast in Pacifica, stating the
      caller must take "affirmative steps" to receive the message
    - This statute has no effect on the number of adult telephone conversations that
      is suitable for children to hear

Reno v ACLU
  - Communications Decency Act has two sections meant to protect minors from "indecent" and
    "patently offensive" communications on the Internet (basically can't send weird shit
    to recipients that are knowingly underage)
  - Court's opinion
    - Struck down those two provisions within the CDA
    - Distinguished Pacifica and CDA: It is difficult to adequately protect the listener
      from unexpected program content, thus 1A is most limited in that medium. But the
      Internet requires more affirmative steps to encounter indecent material
    - Also there was no "lack of precision" in what was banned, creating an unacceptable
      "burden on adult speech"
    - Again cited that government may not reduce the adult population to only what is
      fit for children

Ashcroft v ACLU
  - Congress made COPA (Child Online Protection Act) in response to the Reno case
    - Imposes fine and prison time for knowingly posting, for commercial purposes, on
      the Internet content that is harmful to minors -> defined as any media that
      is obscene
      (a) to the average person -- contemporary community standards
      (b) depicts in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors
      (c) taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, politic, scientific value for minors
    - Also recognizes some affirmable defenses (requiring credit card, digital certificate
      that verifies age, or any other reasonable measures under available tech)
  - Court's opinion
    - District court did not abuse its discretion in entering a preliminary injunction against
      enforcement of COPA
    - There are "plausible, less restrictive alternatives to COPA"
      - Filters considered "less restrictive than COPA" since they restrict speech at the
        receiving end, and not universal restrictions at the source
      - Court believed filters were more effective because it also stopped foreign porn
        for minors, something COPA lacks
      - The argument that "filtering is not a viable alternative bc Congress may not require
        it to be used" is invalid  because requiring parently cooperation does not disqualify
        a less restrictive alternative
  - Dissent by Breyer, Rehnquist, O'Conner:
    - The Act imposes a burden on protected speech that is no more than modest
      - Does not actually censor the material, but just requires verification
    - There is a legitimate compelling interest to protect minors from exposure to
      commercial porn
      - Filtering in its current state does not solve child protection problem, since it is
	(1) faulty, (2) money prohibitive, (3) dependent on parents willingess, (4) lacks
        precision, and may screen out legitimate content

Adult Theater Zoning
  - Young v American Mini-Theatres: Detroit's separate zoning of adult theaters was upheld,
    as it didn't abolish it entirely
    - "Reasonable alternative avenues of communication remained available"
  - This case and City of Renton v Playtime Theatres relied on the fact that such zoning
    relied on "secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community" and not
    on the content itself, and thus past 1A muster
