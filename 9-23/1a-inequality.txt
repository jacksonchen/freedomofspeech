Free Speech Century: Free Speech Inequality

1A law used to stand by the oppressed (socialists, pacificists, excluded).
Now 1A law protects the power (campaign finance, pornography, Klansman)

"A determined blindness" -- unable to tell the difference between relative power and powerlessness
  - In liberalism, the state intervenes to address inquality of power in society
    (civil laws against discrimination)
  - Court's obsession with content neutrality leads to practices of inequality becoming
    expressions of the idea of inequality, which is viewpoint protected
  - "Neutrality as a doctrinal approach can be seen to support the status quo distribution
    of power"
  - 1A must asymmetrically expose harms of discrimination done by expressive means,
    and support expression by subordinated groups against their inequality in order
    to solve the issue
    - Used to be good when 1A cases were against the government (e.g draft dodgers),
      who were powerless in the face of the state
  - Brandenburg
    - The injury of subordinated peoples was reconfigured as injury to the State, such
      that advocating violent means to political and economic change involves such
      danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it
    - The State was not seeking to protect itself or its own power here
  - Clear and present danger to the State should realistically endanger a
    historically subordinated group
  - Currently 1A is a doctrine of "tacit inequality" that replaced the 1A
    equality tradition in early dissents
  - Formal equality turned into content neutrality (aimed against the gov't
    prohibiting the expression of some views more offensive than others)
  - Boy Scouts of America v Dale: Statute prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination
    could not be be applied to the Boy Scouts, since it would ban their viewpoint (?)
    - This concept of neutrality actually depends inequality
  - "Opposing inequality is unequal, a neutrality violation"
  - Obscenity law contains no prohibition on violent depictions: "speech about
    violence is not obscene"
