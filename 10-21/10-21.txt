How do you create a system of freedom of speech and press?
  - Does this include symbolic expression?
  - Is this about communication or language and words

Case: Article says Oxycontin use is rampant and has been a crisis, divulges private
  info about teenagers from the school, drug use was on school grounds

Questions to ask:
  - Is this true? Are they addicted to opioids?
  - What is his status? Is he a public school official? Is this a private or Catholic school?
    - If private school, then this case falls under Gertz
  - If he was public official, need to show actual malice (either false, or reckless
    disregard)
  - If private individual, then we need to show negligence (standard of care
    a reasonable person would not have done this)

Gertz
  - Can sue for punitive damages
  - In civil war, punitive damages is a way for society to punish a defendant not
    in a criminal context (and all that goes along with it)

Libel -> False statement of fact
  - Damage of reputation based on what a reasonable person will understand

1975 Immigration v ___?
  - States cannot punish true statements of fact, even if they are very hurtful

Another case
  - When publication of true facts is offensive and of little value, then the State
    may make that person pay damages

Cox Broadcast Case
  - Supreme Court only held that States cannot protect the privacy of an individual
    against publication of private facts when the information is a matter of public
    record.
  - If it's NOT public record, then no judgement was made.
