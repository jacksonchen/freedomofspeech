Privacy
  - Expansion of the Pentagon Papers case where the gov't basically doesn't have
    much prior restraint over newspapers
  - Expanded to include even confidential info about pending investigations
    (Landmark Communications v Virginia) by saying the gov't should have better
    internal procedures
  - Is there anything so private and non-newsworthy that can be constitutionally restricted?

Cox Broadcasting Corp v Cohn
  - Case: A girl died from a rape, and her identity was not disclosed pending trial.
    In the courtroom, a reporter learned the name of the victim by reading the
    publicly-available indictment records. The name of the victim was reported on Cox.
    Cox claimed they were privileged under 1st and 14th Amendments.
  - Question: Whether a State may extend a cause of action for damages for invasion
    of privacy caused by publication of the name of a deceased rape victim,
    who was publicly revealed in connection with the prosecution of the crime
  - Court: State may NOT pursue charges for newspapers publishing publicly-accessible
    sensitive information
    - The function of the press serves to guarantee "the fairness of trials and to
      bring to bear the beneficial effects of public scrutiny upon the administration
      of justice".
      - Any detail pertaining to the trial is of public concern, and is a responsibility
        of the press to report
    - When information already appears on public record, the "interests in privacy fade"
      - "By placing the information in the public domain on official court records,
        the State must have presumed to have concluded that the public interest was
        thereby being served"
      - It is the responsibility of the State to prevent documents that it doesn't
        want published from leaking
    - None of the words conflict with the fighting words doctrine (Chaplinsky)

If the information was obtained unlawfully: Bartnicki v Vopper
  - Case: Radio station aired a tape of a conversation received from an anonymous source.
    The station knew the tape was procured illegally.
  - Court:
    - State could not stop the radio station from publishing because the call was
      a matter of public concern (collective bargaining negotiations), and the
      broadcaster had not participated directly in the unlawful interception
      (despite knowing that it was illegally procured)
    - "Privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest of publishing
      matters of public importance"
