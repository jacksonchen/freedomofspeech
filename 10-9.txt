Midterm
  - First thing, identify *all* the issues presented by the hypothetical
    - What are the 1A issues presents by the case?
      - List all 1A issues, and then check if each one applies to hypothetical
  - Make the problem as complex as you can
    - To overcome the instinct of "this is the answer"
    - There should be a judgement, but you need to be able to elaborate what the
      arguments on each side is
  - Will never have enough time to answer the question fully
    - Allocate time properly

  - What to know about the cases
    - Don't have to know the names
    - But need to know the critical cases, the facts, and Court's judgement, and
      the Court's doctrine/tests
      - Know what preceded this case (including overruled ones)
  - Arguing against an existing case: State that the status quo is there, but
    the current case is different (compared to that case), and requires a different
    test

Case: Don Jr using cocaine
  - Established Sullivan NYT lays framework for thinking about this
    - Requirements from that case:
      - Speech about public officials that contain false statement of fact that
        damages their reputation can only be the subject of a civil tort lawsuit
        when the plaintiff can show that press/defendant published this false
        statement with actual malice (knowing of its falsity or of reckless disregard)

  - Argument for Don Jr that this fulfills actual malice
    - Basic journalistic standards
      - Reporter, when receiving this story, should contact the person (Don Jr) and
        give them the opportunity to response
      - Argue that this falls so far below journalistic practice that it is classified as
        "reckless disregard"
      - Can argue against the democracy point (in the counterpoint below) that
        the boundary set is way too far, and that the public forum is going to be
        filled with falsehoods, vicious lies about people (about which they have
        no legal redress), will lead to irresponsible people governing,
        we will get people in power who don't care and are insensitive,
        and get a discourse that is highly damaging to a functioning society
      - Press in 1960's was a monopoly, allowing us to control public debate through
        an economic restraint, people with values are able to win out against those
        who don't. Today, it has completely changed, anyone -- including the Russian
        government -- are able to have a voice in our debates today
  - Counterpoint (argument this is fine)
    - St Amant says not following journalistic practice does not constitute reckless disregard
      - Need some conscious awareness that what you're saying is false
    - Sullivan asked to look at the bigger picture and look at how a democracy really functions,
      in order to make sure that people feel free and ready to participate in public debate,
      you must give them space to make errors. You must protect people are who behaving
      below any standard we are comfortable with, since we value robust, uninhibited
      debate.
  - Other arguments for Don Jr
    - Don Jr is not a public official, but a public figure, and thus Sullivan
      doesn't apply
    - Don Jr didn't choose to run for president, he just tweets on politics
  - Counterargument that Don Jr is not a public official
    - Don Jr is closely aligned and briefed on issues of national interest, and
      thus he should be designated as a de facto public official
    - Gertz v Welch extends Sullivan to public figures as well as public officials
      (thus need to show actual malice to prosecute for libel)
      - For private individuals, just needs to show negligence for libel
      - How does the Court define a public figure?
        - If plaintiff purposely throw themselves into public controversy, then
          they would be classified as a public figure (then must show actual malice)
        - "All-purpose public figure": People who are so famous and influential that
          they are always a public figure/official (Court emphasizes these are
          rare people)
        - "Involuntary public figure": An issue may be so powerful and the person
          who suffers libel just has to accept it
          (for our purposes, we can ignore this)
      - In the Gertz case, he (Gertz - attorney in high profile cases) was not
        held to be a public figure, because he is just doing his profession
        even though he's doing high-profile cases
        - Every time the Court tried to answer who is a public figure, they've
          said no and kept the definition extremely narrow
    - Is the cocaine use a public issue?
    - Sullivan, Gertz are only applicable when it's a false statement of fact
      that is injurious to someone
  - Value of discussion around public officials (US v Alvarez, Firestone case)
