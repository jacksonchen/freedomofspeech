Case: Lizzie is President. She appoints Bernie to run the FCC. Bernie says that
  spending money on political advertisements needs to be shut down. Stations and
  networks are no longer allowed to run political advertisements. Says it's outrageous
  that Bloomberg is able to spend $30M on advertising across stations to become
  a relevant candidate. Also says we will take on the Citizens United case --
  will try to impeach justices on the Supreme Court for Citizens United.
  Also no more corporate advertisements, citing the fairness doctrine.

Are Bernie's new rules in the FCC constitutional or not?
  - Citizens United:
    - Case: Citizens United released a movie on Hillary Clinton. Because she was
      a candidate for the Democratic Party, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act
      prohibited them (i.e a corporation) from distributing this film.
    - Citizens United is a non-profit that is legally in a corporate form
    - Case is about if we can limit the speech of corporations in the electoral process.
    - Majority on the Court held that you CANNOT restrict political speech from
      corporations.
    - Argument for why corporations shouldn't be allowed speech
      - Corporations would be unfair to shareholders if they took shareholder money
        and made political statements (contributions)
      - Massive corporations would take over political discourse
      - Bans on corporate limitations on influencing political issues have existed
        for over a century
    - Arguments for why corporations should be allowed speech
      - Newspaper companies (e.g NYT, WaPo) are for-profit companies that play
        very much into influencing public political opinion
      - The fear was way worse than the reality

Supreme Court in campaign finance has drawn a distinction between contributions and expenditures
  - Originated with Buckley v Valeo
  - Campaign contribution include expenditures that are coordinated with a candidate
    (that becomes a contribution)
  - Absent that coordination, expenditures for/against candidates are fully protected
    against any limitations
    - Bloomberg spending $30M on ads, that is counted as expenditures under Buckley v Valeo
  - Contributions may be limited in Buckley because it only entails a "marginal
    restriction" (there are tons of ways to express speech -- i.e expenditures
    not coordinated with the campaign)
    - Government has a compelling state interest to prevent corruption, thus
      contributions may be limited
  - Money *is* the way how speech works, i.e money is speech

Case: If President says you give up the right to criticize the President, then you
  get a $1000 tax credit.
  - Would be unconstitutional
