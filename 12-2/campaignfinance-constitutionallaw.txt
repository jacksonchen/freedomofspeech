Buckley v Valeo
  - Case: Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 has a couple of statutes in question
    (1) Individual political contributions are limited
    (2) Contributions above certain threshold levels must be publicly disclosed
    (3) System for public funding of Presidential campaigns is established
    (4) FEC is established to administer and enforce the legislation
  - Court's opinion
    - Upheld individual contribution limits, disclosure and reporting provisions,
      and public financing
    - Invalidated composition of the FEC, and limitations on expenditures
  - Court's reasoning
    - Provisions should be viewed as regulating conduct, not speech -> thus the
      Act itself is constitutional
    - "Every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the
      expenditure of money"
    - Contribution limits are okay
      - Contribution limits to a candidate or political committee entails "only
        a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free
        communication".
      - The campaigns' spending of contribution money involves
        speech by someone other than the contributor, and thus does not infringe
        on the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues
      - "Neither the right to associate nor the right to participate in political
        activities is absolute". The State has a legitimate interest to limit
        contribution limits because of "political quid pro quo" that undermine
        "our system of representative democracy"
      - Bribery laws aren't enough in itself, as those are only the most blatant
        attempts
    - Expenditure limits are NOT okay
      - The State does not have a legitimate enough of an interest to prevent
        corruption and the appearance of corruption in curtailing free speech
      - Expenditures have "alleviates the danger" of quid pro quo
      - "The concept that the government may restrict speech of some in order to
        enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to 1A"
      - Candidates' personal expenditures cannot b e limited as that is their
        First Amendment right to engage in discussion of public issues
      - Furthermore, campaign expenditure limits are also not justified in
        restricting the quantity of political expression -> "1A denies the gov't
        the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views
        is wasteful, excessive, or unwise"
  - Burger's dissent on contribution limits
    - "Contributions and expenditures are two sides of the same 1A coin"
  - White's dissent on expenditure limits
    - "The argument that money is speech and that limiting the flow of money to
      the speaker violates the 1A proves entirely too much"
    - Taxation on newspapers where they could spend the money on speech is
      widely accepted and constitutionally acceptable
    - "Expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and help eradicate
      the hazard of corruption"
  - Marshall dissent on expenditure limits:
    - No expenditure limits "discourage potential candidates without significant
      personal wealth from entering the political area"
    - Also undermiens public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process

McConnell v FEC
  - Case: Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act targeted "soft money", which was activities
    that influence elections if they mentioned a federal candidate's name as long
    as the ads did not expressly advocate the candidate's election or defeat
    - BCRA banned national party committees and their agents from soliciting or
      spending any soft money
    - Federal election activity that soft money funds comes in four forms:
      (1) Voter registration activity during 120 days preceding a scheduled federal election
      (2) Voter identification and get out the vote (GOTV), also generic campaign
          activity conducted in connection with an election
      (3) Any "public communication" that refers to a clearly identified candidate
          and takes a stance on them
      (4) Services provided to state committee employee who dedicate 25% of more
          of their time on election related activities
  - Court's opinion: BCRA is not unconstitutional limitation of 1A
    - Court agreed with the ban on soft money
      - Government has legitimate interest to prevent corruption or its appearance,
        and thus can justify political contribution limits
      - Court agrees with Congress that large soft money contributions from national
        party committees have a corrupting influence
      - Court also agrees with BCRA's predictive limit on contributions to state
        party committees as they see state committees as a loophole that would be exploited
    - Court also upheld the "electioneering communication" ban (any communication
      made within 60 days of general election funded by corporations or unions)
  - Justice Scalia's dissent in part
    - Soft money makes it even handed, which is unfair for challengers to incumbents
      since incumbents raise much more hard money
  - Justice Kennedy, Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas dissent in part
    - Believes banning soft money goes beyond actual or apparent quid pro quo
      arrangements, thus overly restrictive of speech

FEC v Wisconsin Right to Life
  - New conservative majority said that the electioneering communications component
    only referred to the "'functional equivalent' of express campaign speech",
    which was constitutionally validated. However, the speech in that case was
    "genuine" issue ads, which could not be regulated under 1A
  - The speech was found to be a "genuine" issue ad, and thus was protected by 1A
  - Dissent claimed that there was no good justification to violate stare decisis

Davis v FEC
  - Case: "Millionaire's amendment" -- if a candidate spends $350k or more on their
    own election, then opposing candidate could accept contributions 3x the normal limit.
  - Court's opinion: Referred to the Buckley case, where a cap on candidate's expenditure
    was banned. Said that be raising the opponent's contribution limit would disincentivize
    candidates from spending their own campaign money, thus chilling 1A speech
  - Dissent is that the personal expenditures of a candidate is not capped, and thus
    there is no 1A issue here

Arizona Free Enterprise Club v Bennett
  - Arizona has a public financing scheme for candidates who opt in, where if their
    opponent raises above a certain limit through private contributions (which
    is unlimited), then there would be a 1 to 1 public dollar matching
  - Court decided this was unconstitutional as it again chills private contribution
    speech by posing a "penalty"
  - Dissent said that private contributions weren't capped, and also a public
    financing scheme was also deemed constitutional under Buckley, and also having
    fair elections was also a legitimate interest of the state

Citizens United v FEC
  - Case: Citizens United is a nonprofit that released a movie on Hillary Clinton.
    BCRA bans corporations from making independent expenditures that expressly
    advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.
    - Law in question: Federal Law bans corporations and unions from using treasury funds for
      electioneering communications or for speech expressly advocating defeat/election
      of a candidate.
    - McConnell case (which upheld BCRA) relies on the Austin case, which held that
      political speech may be banned based on speaker's corporate identity
  - Court's opinion:
    - Overturns Austin and McConnell
    - 1A prohibits restrictions distinguishing among different speakers. BCRA
      only bans corporations and unions from electioneering communications within
      a certain number of days of an election, but it doesn't ban individuals
      from doing the same.
    - "We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech,
      the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers"
      - Deprives "disadvantaged persons or class of the right to use specch..."
    - Finds that 1A protection extends to corporations (Cox Broadcasting, NYT v US,
      NYT v Sullivan). Thus political speech does not lose 1A protection "simply
      because its source is a corporation"
    - Decided to overturn the Austin case
      - Austin uses the anti-distortion doctrine: "The corrosive and distorting
        effects of immense aggregations of wealth...have little or no correlation
        to the public's support for the corporation's ideas"
      - Court sees that the Buckley argument where the Government has no 1A role
        in suppressing some speech to equalize it with other speech flies in
        the face of the anti-distortion doctrine
      - The corporations, despite getting some special benefits, do not lose their
        1A rights -> "When Government seeks to use its full power, including the
        criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information
        or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to
        control thought. This is unlawful."
      - Court returns the doctrine back to what was established in Bellotti, where
        the Government cannot suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's
        corporate identity
      - Thus, the Court also overrules the electioneering communications component
        of BCRA, and that respective ruling within McConnell
    - "When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due
      deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy"
  - Roberts and Alito's concurrence:
    - Stare decisis is important, but the Austin case conflicts with the Buckley
      case, and has "proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among
      Members of this Court ever since"
  - Justices' Stevens and others Dissent:
    - They agree that 1A prevents regulatory distinctions based on a speaker's
      identity, but corporations are fundamentally not people (corporations
      are not members of our society) and thus this identity-based argument
      would not apply
      - There is also widely accepted proof on the corruption of corporation
        spending in elections, and thus further undermines the identity argument
    - Austin and McConnell are NOT radical outliers in 1A tradition, as the majority
      opinion claims those cases to be
      - This decision overturns a century of 1A precedent
      - There is no empirical evidence that Austin is undermined, which the majority
        opinion claims
      - From an originalist perspective, corporations were quasi-public entities
        and were clearly distinguished from human beings: "Members of the founding
        generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of
        corporate rights, and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms"
      - Legislative and judicial jurisprudence starting from the Tillman Act (1907)
        banning all corporate contributions to candidates, to FECA in 1971 and
        Buckley, Austin cases
      - Majority's Bellotti argument is wrong: That case stated that "our consideration
        of a corporation's right to speak on issues of general public interest
        implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in
        a political campaign for election to public office" -> Literally disavows
        the equivalence of a corporate speaker with a human speaker
    - The government has a legitimate interest in regulating corporate speech in
      terms of anticorruption
      - "It is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress' years of bipartisan
        deliberation and its reasoned judgment n this basis without first confirming
        that the statute in question was intended to be a restraint on electoral competition"
        (which it isn't)
      - Austin's anti-distortion rationale is itself an anticorruption rationale,
        thus a legitimate government interest and just an "equalizing" ideal in disguise
      - Corporations may have a formidable political presence through their treasuries,
        "even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power
        of its ideas"
      - Corporations using treasury money for political purposes go at odds against
        dissenting shareholders and union members, and there is an established legitimate
        interest in protecting these members within campaign finance reform

American Tradition Partnership v Bullock
  - Case: Montana found that their political process tended to be corrupted by
    mining and energy influences, and thus enacted corporate expenditure restrictions.
    Montana Supreme Court upheld the law.
  - Supreme Court overturned the Montana law because it wasn't sufficiently found
    to be different from Citizen's United.

McCutcheon v FEC
  - BCRA imposes (1) base limits on contributions to a particular candidate [upheld
    in Buckley] and (2) aggregate limits to how much a candidate may donate to
    all candidates
  - Case: Whether aggregate limits are constitutional under 1A
  - Court: Ruled that aggregate limits were unconstitutional
    - Cited Buckley in stating that Congress may regulate campaign contributions
      to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption
    - "Congress may not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of
      money in politics, or to restrict the political participation of some in
      order to enhance the relative influence of others (Bennett)"
    - Aggregate limits that adhere to base limit do not prevent additional corruption,
      since corruption is the only legitimate interest the gov't has in restricting
      campaign contributions, the aggregate limits fail 1A test
  - Dissent by Justice Breyer and liberal wing:
    - The majority's definition of corruption is too narrow, and that maintaining
      integrity of public government is more important: "Where enough money calls
      the tune, the general public will not be heard"
    - Corruption and the presence of large money destroys a free marketplace
      of political ideas; people will believe their voice have little purpose and
      "a cynical public can lose interest in political participation altogether"

US Civil Service Commission v National Association of Letter Carriers
  - Case: Constitutionality of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees
    from soliciting contributions for a partisan political purpose, taking an
    active part in a political campaign, soliciting votes for an candidate, or
    endorsing any candidate
  - Court: Upheld the Hatch Act: "It is not only important the gov't employees in
    fact avoid practicing political justice, but also that they appear to the
    public to be avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative
    Government is not to be eroded"
    - Gov't employees need to be free from voting in a certain way or for
      performing political chores

Pickering v Board of Education
  - Teacher dismissed for sending a letter to local newspaper about the recently
    proposed tax increased. Letter was critical of the Board and district superintendent.
    Teacher was dismissed.
  - Court: Held teacher's right to freedom of speech was violated
    - Reject the notion that government can dismiss employees on matters of
      public concern
    - However, if the speech was personal in nature (i.e no on matters of public
      concern) -- say critical of another teacher's driving, then the government
      is free to do whatever it wants regarding that employee (Connick v Meyers)

Elrod v Burns
  - Case: New sheriff was a Democrat. He discharged a bunch of non-civil service
    employees for not being members of the Democratic Party.
  - Court: Held this practice unconstitutional
    - Dismissing employees based on political patronage places a restraint on freedoms
      of belief and association
    - Difference of political beliefs does not cause a noticeable drop in productivity,
      or effective work, thus political patronage is not allowed
    - Limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions to sufficient to
      achieve this governmental end

Strict Scrutiny -- when challenged restriction has relatively severe effect (Button, Buckley for expenditure limits)
Intermediate scrutiny -- when challenged restriction has significant, not severe effect (Schneider, Buckley for contribution limits, Martin)
Deferential scrutiny -- when restriction has relatively modest effect (O'Brien, Heffron)
