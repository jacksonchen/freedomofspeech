Constitutional Law Book: Content-Based Restrictions
  - Conditions that restrictions to free speech may occur
    - Speech that may harm audience to engage in unlawful conduct
      - Draft dodging (Espionage Act 1917 and Sedition Act 1918)
        - Masses Publishing Co vs Patten
          - Masses published social satire and political criticism. August issue
            would be denied access to mail under the Sedition Act by the Postmaster
            because "one may not counsel or advise others to violate the law as it stands".
          - Political agitation may "stimulate men to the violation of law"
          - But the judge ruled that the materials did not advocate resistance to the draft
            - "One may admire and approve the course of a hero without feeling any duty to follow him"
            - "stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law"
          - "The Hand formula is overprotective of the clever inciter" -> if the
            inciter is clever enough to avoid use of incitement language (1348)
          - Hand also is "overprotective of dangerous speakers" (such as telling mobs
            information that incites violence)
        - Schenck v US
          - Made documents that claimed that citizens had the right to resist the draft,
            and that it is their duty to resist the draft as well
          - "When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace
            are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so
            long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by
            any constitutional right" (1345)
          - Clear and Present Danger -- Shouting fire in a theater; but this doesn't
            take intent into account (what if it was true?)
        - Frohwerk v US
          - Frokhwerk was convicted under Espionage Act of 1917 for his articles
            declaring the war a mistake, and calling the war "outright murder" (1350)
          - Judge Holmes: 1A "cannot have been, and obviously was not, intended to give
            immunity for every possible use of language" (1350)
          - "On the record it is impossible to say that it might not have been found
            that the circulation of the paper was in quarters where a little breath
            would be enough to kindle a flame" (1350)
        - Debs v US
          - Eugene Debs was convicted under Espionage Act of 1917 for obstructing
            enlistment
          - Supreme Court upheld the conviction stating that speech that opposed
            the war and its "probably effect" was not protected
          - In particular, Holmes pointed out Debs praised people who were convicted
            of encouraging others to refuse induction
          - No reference to "clear and present danger"
        - Gitlow v New York
          - Gitlow was indicted for criminal anarchy for being in a radical leftist
            org that published a manifesto on overthrowing the US government
          - Majority opinion
            - Statute does not penalize publication of abstract "doctrine" or
              academic discussion having no quality of incitement to any concrete action
              (1360)
            - However, the Manifesto was concluded to not to be an abstract doctrine
              or academic discussion -- uses "fervent language mass action" (1360)
            - The state "seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has
              enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration" (1361) -> hence
              why the New York statute is legal
          - Holmes & Dissenting opinion
            - Manifesto has no present danger to overthrow the government
            - "Every idea is an incitement"
            - First Amendment "experiment" (see below)
          - Questions that this case presents
            - Holmes discusses a marketplace of ideas -- where ideas are experiments
              that get tested in the market. However, as some evils so grave that
              we cannot afford to experiment?
            - The idea of governance is that the citizens make decisions as to how
              they should be governed, and 1A is to prevent those in power from
              preventing citizens from expressing new ideas to govern -- why should
              the government make these judgement calls?
    - Speech that threatens harm to others
    - Speech that provokes a hostile audience response
    - Speech that discloses confidential information

Free Speech Century
  - Dialogue
    - Free speech "experiment" (from Justice Holmes)
      - Chilling effect -- An individual does not have much incentive to use free
        speech, but a group has much bigger effect, causing government to
        intimidate to silence critics
      - Pretext effect -- Gov't officials will defends restrictions on speech
        differently from their real motives (such as suppressing political thought)
      - Crisis effect -- During times of crisis, intolerance will grow; Court needs
        to structure 1A to anticipate and guard against the worst of times
  - First chapter
    - Hand, Holmes, and Brandies spent a lot of time invalidating laws passed
      by political majorities
      - This set them up to eventually set up 1A jurisprudence (against majority rule)
      - Hand saw freedom of speech as a "majority creating procedure rather than
        an individual right" (14)
        - In Masses case, he proposed a test where the message conveyed should be
          evaluated, not the predicted consequences of the speech or the
          speaker's illicit intent -> otherwise the democratic state would be able
          to control speech
        - However, most successful political movements in the US started through
          calls for illegal action, and Hand's test fails to cover those
        - Hand was significant in determining the boundary b/w protected and
          unprotected speech
    - Holmes
      - "Clear and present danger" test
        - Falsely shouting "Fire!" in a theater
      - Marketplace of ideas metaphor
      - Voted against Debs in stating his situation wasn't a fundamental free speech
        principle but a "matter of proximity and degree"
