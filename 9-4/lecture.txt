Things to look at in a case (briefing a case)
  - Facts of case
  - Procedural posture (e.g raised for a motion to dismiss)
  - What were the issues presented to the Court
  - What did the Court perceive to be the issue to be decided
  - What was the result?
  - What were the reasons for concurring & dissenting opinions?

How "bad" does speech have to be before it's no longer protected?
  - Should Wikileaks be protected under 1A that was afforded to NYT & WaPo
    in the Pentagon Papers case?
  - Should publishers be able to publish injurious & false statements of
    fact about public officials? (NYT v Sullivan)?
  - To what extent should money be protected by 1A for political purposes?

-----------------------

Scenario: Vigilante group for pro-border wall where a speech was given, and
  a command was given to start conducting citizens arrests on the border
  - Going to areas without Border Patrol
  - Speech giver was arrested and this was brought ahead as a 1A case

Plenty of areas of speech that aren't protected
  - Insider trading
  - Inciting violence
  - Commercials, etc

Hugo Black (Supreme Court Justice for 1A)
  - He believes that speech is absolutely protected
  - No law abridging the freedom of speech
    - "Freedom of speech" is very flexible
    - Original intent vs something else

Supreme Court 1A cases began in 1919 with Schenck, Frohwerk, and Debs

Schenck
  - Call to action for illegal action during *time of war*
  - Whether or not a call to action for illegal action is protected or not
    *entirely* depends on proximity and degree
