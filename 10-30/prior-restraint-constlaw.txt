This section is focusing on what types of restrictions are constitutionally permissible

Overbreadth and Vagueness
  - Gooding v Wilson
    - Case: During antiwar demonstration, a protestor was in a scuffle with police
      where he made some threats. Was charged with violating Georgia code stating
      that anyone who uses abusive language, tending to cause a breach of peace shall be
      guilty of a misdemeanor.
    - Court's opinion:
      - Statutes limiting use of words or language must be narrowly limited (citing Chaplinsky)
      - Appellant argued that Georgia statute only applies to fighting words,
        but the Court disagrees and believes that it is too broad
      - The statute can be applied to utterances where there was "no likelihood
        that the person addressed would make an immediate violent response, it is
        clear that the standard allowing juries to determine guilt does not
        limit the application of [the statute] to fighting words defined in Chaplinsky"
      - Overbroad statutes will chill constitutionally protected speech because
        of the "fear of criminal sanctions provided by statute susceptible of
        application to protected expression"
  - 1A Overbreadth Doctrine
    - It tests constitutionality of legislation in terms of its potential applications.
      Thus banning advocating unlawful conduct would be unconstitutional "on its face"
      because the law forbids expression that the state may not constitutionally prohibit
    - Broadly worded laws will deter protected speech, thus this doctrine needs
      to exist
    - "There must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly
      compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before
      the Court for it to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds"
      (Los Angeles City Council v Taxpayers for Vincent)
  - Vagueness
    - "A law of void on its face if it is so vague that persons 'of common intelligence
      must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its applications'"
      (Connally v General Construction Co)
    - It inhibits exercising 1A freedom because of the vagueness chills speech
    - Grayned v City of Rockford: Court rejected vagueness challenge because
      "we think it is clear what the ordinance as a whole prohibits".
      The city ordinance stated: "no person, while on public or private grounds
      adjacent to any building in which a school is in session, shall willfully
      make noise or diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or
      good order of such school"
    - Smith v Goguen: Banning "treating contemptuously the flag of the US" is
      too vague ("failed to draw reasonably clear lines between what is criminal
      and what are not")

Prior Restraint
  - Patterson v Colorado: Court declared Constitution prohibited "all such previous
    restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments"
  - Court has steadfastly held that there is a special presumption under 1A against
    the use of prior restraints
    - Prior restraint may be invalid even if the expression at issue CAN be restricted
  - Lovell v Griffin
    - Case: Lovell was convicted of city ordinance for distributing a pamphlet
      without getting the necessary permission to do so.
      The ordinance states that all distribution of literature within the city
      must require written permission from the city manager
    - Court's opinion: The ordinance is "invalid on its face". Its character
      is such that it "strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press
      by subjecting it to license and censorship"
      - The liberty of the press became initially a right to publish without a license
    - It is likely the Court shut it down because it is "standardless licensing",
      i.e no way to verify if denied permits were because of censorship or for
      legitimate reasons (Kunz v New York)
  - Cox v New Hampshire: Licensing with standards was upheld by the Court, because
    there were narrow guidelines that the licensing board could use to deny requests,
    and those guidelines pertained to proper use of streets and not censorship.
  - Freeman v Maryland
    - Case: Freedman violated state motion picture censorship statute by exhibiting a
      film (which was NOT obscene) without submitting it to the State Board of Censors
    - Court:
      - The statute was invalid
      - Unlike a prosecution for obscenity, a censorship proceeding puts the initial
        burden on the exhibitor or distributor. A censor's business is to censor,
        and thus may well be less responsive than a court to constitutionally
        protect interest in free expression
      - Court also stated that procedural safeguards were put in place to obviate
        the dangers of a censorship system, that this would actually be okay.
        Examples of constitutionally required safeguards:
        - Burden of proving the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor
        - Only a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding can suffice
          to impose a valid final restraint
          - Restraint imposed in advance of judicial resolution must be limited
            to the status quo and be for the shortest fixed period compatible
        - Censor must, within a brief period, issue a license or go to court to
          restrain showing the film
        - Procedure must assure a prompt final judicial decision to minimize the
          deterrent effect of an interim and erroneous denial of a license
  - Near v Minnesota
    - Case: Minnesota statute required the abatement of "malicious, scandalous and
      defamatory newspaper, magazine, or other periodical." Statute also provided
      that there "shall be available the defense that the truth was published with
      good motives and for justifiable ends"
      - County attorney brought this against the Saturday Press for running an article
        critical of the chief police, charging him with "gross neglect of duty"
    - Court's opinion: Statute is unconstitutional
      - "The protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited,
        but the limitation has been recognized only in exceptional cases"
      - Examples when prior restraint is granted:
        - Obstruction of military recruiting
        - Publication of number and location of troops, or sailing dates of transports
      - However, this statute does not protect the security of community life, as
        there are no historical prior restraints against malfeasance of public officers;
        thus the prior restraint here is unjustified
      - Furthermore, censorship cannot place the burden on the publisher to show that
        the matter is true and "published with good motives and for justifiable ends"
  - Injunctions: More powerful than prior restraint, because of the "collateral bar rule"
    - People under injunction have no ability to persuade court of statute's
      unconstitutionality; they are expected to obey the decree until it is modified
      or reversed (Walker v City of Birmingham - Restraining order from street parades)
    - Targeted at specific people, rather than ordinances are more generally applied
    - Pittsburgh Press Co v Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations
      - Case: Pittsburgh Press violated ordinance by displaying "help wanted"
        advertisements designating job preference by sex. City ordered the newspaper
        from carrying sex-designated ads in the future.
      - Court: Upheld the order
        - "We have never held that all injunctions are impermissible"
        - The present order does not endanger arguably protected speech
    - Madsen v Women's Health Center
      - Court held that injunction prohibiting particular individuals from demonstrating
        within 36 feet of an abortion clinic was not "prior restraint" because
        the injunction was issued NOT because of expression but because of "prior
        unlawful conduct"
      - Court held that content-neutral injunctions are not prior restraints, but
        nevertheless should be tested by more rigorous standards because injunctions
        carry greater risks of censorship and discriminatory application than general ordinances
