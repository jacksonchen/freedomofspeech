Case: Organization (WNP) goes around the country making hateful, racist statements.
  Whenever a mass shooting occurs, WNP issues statements expressing praise & approval,
  claiming these people should be emulated. There's a call on the website for people
  to take violent action.

  The organization also holds a national conference on how to use weapons, making
  bombs, etc. Is all of this activity protected by 1A?

Brandenburg - "clear" means "likely"
  - KKK rally that was broadcasted to local and national statements
  - Prosecution against the KKK
  - Judgement
    - Speech is protected unless EXPLICITLY advocates illegal action
    - Three prongs that need to be satisfied to not be protected:
      - Express advocacy
      - Imminent (immediate) action
      - Likely that the imminent action would occur
    - There is no imminence factor here, there are no people present besides
      Klansmen and reporters, this is likely an indirect threat

Boundaries of free speech
  - In Masses, Judge Hand said only speech that explicitly advocates for violent or illegal
    action is unprotected.
  - Holmes and the Court uses the "clear and present danger" test
    - Depends on the context and the facts, and the causal link between the speech
      and the action
    - The gov't has to prove that there is a clear danger and risk that illegal
      behavior would happen
    - Judge Hand doesn't like this because it gives judges way too much manipulation
      based on their personal opinions. Thus he believed there needs to be a strict
      and easy test.
      - The issue with Hand's approach is that implication and indirection that may
        be completely dangerous (and provoke action) would be let go
      - Not using *any* context is too loose
  - Brandenburg is seem as a mix of Hand's approach and "clear and present danger" test
    - Not only is there a requirement that it must be dangerous and imminent, but
      it also must be explicit
    - This is an extremely protective interpretation of 1A

Dennis vs US
  - Communists organized, convicted under Smith Act
  - Judgement:
    - Speech to overthrow the government is not protected
    - Decided on more of the gravity of the harm rather than the likelihood
  - Viewed (like Schenck, Debs, Frohwerk) as one of the low points of 1A doctrine
    - Brandenburg is seen as having rejected Dennis' doctrine (despite
      not being explicitly overruled)

Back to the case in hand:
  - Applying Brandenberg's rules, this organization would be protected
  - How to argue that in this case, the speech is not protected
    - In 1960 in Brandenberg, KKK was a minor threat to society despite being
      a terrible organization
    - Today, a new white nationalist movement that is rising that is posing a much
      larger danger to society than the KKK did in Brandenberg (e.g current
      mass murderers)
    - When a new organization is rising with lots of power and potential to cause
      harm, the government must step in
